This past September ClimeWorks launched the world‚Äôs largest ‚Äúcarbon sucking‚Äù plant known as Orca designed to reverse global warming. It utilizes geothermal power from the Hengell volcano in Iceland to propel giant fans that suck air out of the atmosphere and pass it through a filter. The filter is then released of the CO2 that is subsequently converted into a carbonate and buried permanently beneath the rock layer. It is estimated that this plant prototype is capable of removing CO2 from the atmosphere that is the equivalent of 870 cars.

We need to invest in ""carbon sucking"" direct air capture plants to reverse all of the damage from bitcoin mining, air travel, and driving.

I thought I would share some of my thoughts regarding the tension between value investing and software businesses. Would love some of your comments and feedback on this to see if you agree / disagree with particular parts.

\---

Value investing is a form of allocating capital based on the principle of identifying good businesses that are trading below their ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù value. Often, they are companies that are trading at a discount relative to their assets, the strength of their earnings or the steadiness of their cash flows. Value investing has proven to be a successful investment strategy, having made numerous millionaires and billionaires, including Warren Buffet.

However, the principles of value investing have been questioned over the past decade. Value stocks have performed terribly since the 2008 financial crisis, while growth stocks have performed exceptionally well during this period. Specifically, a large portion of overall market performance through the past decade has been captured by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) and other software-driven technology companies, which value investors have typically avoided due to high valuations. The post lockdown recovery has further highlighted the attractive returns provided by software-driven companies as several technology stocks are at all-time highs. That seems to be changing a bit with inflation, however the 10 year return metrics cannot be ignored. 

Value investing has gone through existential crises numerous times before and survived. I suspect it will overcome the current skepticism it is facing, as the core principles of value investing are still useful. However, as a prudent investor, I must continue to navigate changing market dynamics, question the principles of value investing and determine what, if anything, has changed.

**Devoured By Software**

Software has become a key part of our lives today. Yet understanding the full implications and potential of software-driven companies is difficult due to the varied levels of success these companies can have. Products can be category defining (Google Search) or useless (Apple Maps). For all their unpredictability, software-driven companies as a category still demand high valuations. As such, value investors have stayed away from the space and missed out on their returns over the past decade.

Marc Andreessen began exploring the implications of software-driven business in his 2011 essay [Why Software Is Eating The World](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). His essay serves as a great starting point for considering the following key questions of (1) whether the economic and business model changes of software justify the high valuations demanded by these firms and (2) whether the value investing framework is still effective in allocating capital in the markets today.

# An Expensive Opportunity.

There are three key characteristics of software-driven companies that could justify their expensive valuations: 1) Incremental marginal profits; 2) Scale and reach; and 3) Increasing return to scale.

**1) Incremental Marginal Profits:**

Software-driven businesses are characterized by high initial fixed costs. The R&amp;D costs required to get a product to market is massive. However, the incremental cost for each product sold is marginal. Profits can grow quickly once break-even is achieved, leading to a massive boost in profitability.

This is in contrast to traditional ‚Äúphysical‚Äù businesses where the ability to increase profits is limited by the variable costs and step costs of selling the product. While it might be impossible to predict which software products will take-off and what the magnitude of profitability growth will be, failure to understand the mechanics of software-driven business models makes software companies seem expensive.

**2) Scale &amp; Reach:**

A key distinction between software-driven businesses and physical businesses is the former‚Äôs ability to scale. Roughly 3.5 billion people in the world currently have access to smartphones and the internet ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/)). A new product can reach millions, if not billions, of people faster than ever before and this trend is only accelerating with time. It took Instagram roughly 8 years to get to a billion active daily users; it will take TikTok roughly 3 ([source](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/) &amp; [source](https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/)).

An important driver of the rapid growth of technology firms is the low cost of scaling software. Software-driven businesses are not hindered by the common limitations that constrain physical businesses (i.e. supply chain logistics, key real estate in major markets, physical resources and inputs, etc.), which increase costs and delay growth. Software-driven businesses can take advantage of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (i.e. Amazon Web Services) and other key services to reduce the cost of scaling. Gerald F. Davis, professor at the University of Michigan, has estimated that the cost of launching a start-up has decreased by a magnitude of 100x in the past decade ([source](https://bthechange.com/the-declining-cost-of-startup-companies-c5a9a72bf1e6)).

**3) Increase Return To Scale:**

A core heuristic of value investors has been the [law of diminishing returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp) and [regression to the mean](https://theconversation.com/regression-to-the-mean-or-why-perfection-rarely-lasts-74694). Benjamin Graham, the godfather of value investing, summarized the notion best with the phrase: *‚ÄúMany shall be restored that are now fallen and many shall fall that now are held in honor.‚Äù*

However, software has potentially increased the ability of firms to better fight these principles through network effects and increased returns to scale. W. Brian Arthur is credited for the modern description of the concept:

*Increasing returns are the tendency for that which is ahead to get further ahead, for that which loses advantage to lose further advantage. They are mechanisms of positive feedback that operate‚Äîwithin markets, businesses, and industries‚Äîto reinforce that which gains success or aggravate that which suffers loss‚Ä¶*

*More than causing products to become standards, increasing returns cause businesses to work differently, and they stand many of our notions of how business operates on their head.*

Software-driven businesses are often characterized by network effects and increasing returns to scale. As these businesses grow, their advantages become stronger, their probability of launching successful new products higher, and ability to scale them globally better.

Let‚Äôs use Google Search as an example. The more people use search, the better the product becomes. The better the product, the larger their competitive advantage, and the harder it is for a new entrant to compete. The better the product, the most people will continue to use Google Search instead of an alternative (do you know anyone who uses [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)?) and the positive feedback loop will continue.

Contrast this to one of my favorite business that operates in the physical space, Lululemon. Every time I wear the Surge shorts, the product doesn‚Äôt become better. While there is an argument that the customer data Luluemon gains can improve their products, that iterative process is not as rapid, scalable and impactful as it is for software-driven firms.

# A New Paradigm?

The combined impact of these characteristics creates a fly-wheel effect where select software-driven businesses experience lottery like pay-offs. Traditional valuation approaches are not well-suited to understanding these low-probability-high-reward scenarios.

However, that doesn‚Äôt mean value investing is no longer useful. The principle idea behind value investing is to pay a price that is less than the ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù value of an asset. The better you are at finding this gap between price and value, the larger your margin of safety and ability to make money. But some of the traditional heuristics and mental models associated with value investing need to be reconsidered.

Traditional valuation approaches considered risk to be a bug, not a feature. However, the three characteristics of software-driven companies described above incentivize software-driven firms to chase risky projects that have lottery-like payoffs. A [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2018/06/why-we-need-to-update-financial-reporting-for-the-digital-era) written by Professor Govindarajan, described how ‚Äú*an idea with uncertain prospects but with at least some conceivable chance of reaching a billion dollars in revenue is considered far more valuable than a project with net present value of few hundred million dollars but no chance of massive upside*‚Äù to software-driven companies.

This is truer the larger the company is. If Apple considered a high probability of success project with a profit boost of $500m (which is significant by most standards), it would only lead to a 1% increase in their 2019 full-year net income of \~$55bn. They would likely pass in favor of something riskier but with more upside.

An alternative valuation framework is offered by CFOs of software-driven companies. These CFOs themselves admit that their market capitalizations cannot be justified based on traditional metrics. They speculate that perhaps their valuation might be the sum of the potential pay-offs of all the projects undertaken by their companies, now and in the future. This framework is closer to the venture capital world than traditional value investing. However, over-reliance on this approach would likely cause investors to be irrationally optimistic and over-value every single software-driven company.

How then do we reconcile the core principle of value investing and this new lens through which to view software-driven companies? I suspect the answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Investors would be foolish to violate the core principle of value investing. However, investors would be equally foolish in failing to recognize that the software business model has changed the incremental economics for select businesses. Perhaps the most prudent use of this framework is to understand that it applies infrequently, but when it does apply, it justifies the valuations. That takes judgement. And judgement is what separates investors from speculators.

Thanks for reading and would love your thoughts!

Bull thesis on Exelon Corporation $EXC

Last edited 1/13/22

TLDR at the bottom

Exelon is a Fortune 100 company that work‚Äãs in every stage of the energ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãy business: power generation, competitive energy sales, transmission and delivery with revenues of $33 billion‚Äã‚Äã. It is also the largest provider of carbon free energy having the largest nuclear fleet in the US. 

Recently Exelon‚Äôs share price has taken a hit due to unfavorable energy prices that have been surprised by a decade of cheap natural gas prices and a bloated balance sheet which is has significant liabilities coming due this year. 

https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/utilities/nasdaq-exc/exelon/news/does-exelon-nasdaqexc-have-a-healthy-balance-sheet-1

Exelon runs a number of healthy utility companies that focus of transmission and delivery energy that have had a number of favorable rate cases over the years. Exelon has however not managed it‚Äôs generation business well and recently decided to spin off Exelon Generation and it‚Äôs sales business Constellation to derisk its business and with it  dumping a lot of its debt (which currently sits with the generation assets) into a new company so it can focus solely on its regulated utility business. 

https://www.pottsmerc.com/2021/11/22/exelon-moving-nuclear-plants-to-spin-off-company/amp/


Exelon has released its separation from Exelon generation will happen Feb 1st naming the new board of directors and analyst day.

https://www.exeloncorp.com/newsroom/new-constellation-board-of-directors-named

Exelon‚Äôs remaining utility business that house seven regulated utilities in the Midwest and Northeast will use its $27 billion capital investment plan to support 7.5% annual rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth.

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/exc/quote

Corvex Management, an activist investor, estimated in October the company could be worth about $60 a share if it separates its assets. Exelon said in November it was conducting a review of its operations and that it had advisers to evaluate such a move.

https://www.bloombergquint.com/amp/business/exelon-plans-to-separate-power-generation-business-via-spinoff

Exelon also stands to benefit heavily from the build back better plan but taking advantage of its 11 billion dollars for reliability projects on the grid

https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-the-infrastructure-bill-could-change-doe-nuclear-grid/

Getting in EXC now gets you exposure to its spin-off company as well, as Exelon shareholders will get one share of Constellation for every three shares of EXC they own on Feb. 1, 2022

EXC price target recently updated to $68 in the near term

https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/22/01/24861999/analyst-ratings-for-exelon

TLDR 
Exelon share price is being depressed by its generation fleets debt and poor energy prices due to natural gas. Exelon is separating it‚Äôs regulated utility business away from its generation business which will remove a significant amount of debt from its balance sheet and derisk it business from volitive energy prices. There is a current investment opportunity to buy Exelon at its declined current price or purchase dirt cheap
Options and ride the upside wave after its separation on Feb 1.

I.e. I‚Äôm currently borrowing about 47% of my portfolio‚Äôs value in margin (not including retirement accounts, which you can‚Äôt take margin out on). I plan to reduce this to about 25-30% by year-end depending on the speed of rate hikes.

It‚Äôs interesting to consider how high margin debt is (918.6 billion as of 11/30) as rates start increasing this year; is there any relatively recent empirical research exploring individual investors‚Äô/funds‚Äô sensitivity to rate hikes in terms of margin?

Overall, margin is still only about 2.5% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs total market capitalization so I suppose nothing really alarming could stem from margin use itself, but I‚Äôm curious as to how others are adjusting their margin usage as rates increase

I know Peter Lynch has suggested using an RRR of **6%**, but that was probably written in a time when bond-rates were higher than today. **Presumably the RRR can be less than 6% today, as there are few investments alternatives to stocks that in todays economy give 6%.**

I also assume that RRR changes with time, depending on the changes of the risk-free interest rate (US 10 year bond rate).

General wisdom is that RRR when holding a stock should be much higher than the interest that companies pay on their debt, because you as a stock holder take on more risk than bond holders. Most stocks these days seems to be paying less than 1% interest on their debt, sometimes a lot less. 

So likely RRR is something above 1% and below 6%? 

A related question is: **how can you gauge the market average RRR in a simple way?** One idea I had was to look at the average dividend payout of US regional banks with little historic growth and little historic growth prospects. Presumably the main reason to own a stock like that is to get a dividend payout, and the market will bid up the price of these stocks until the dividend yield is below the RRR?

A quick [screen](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=161&amp;f=fa_epsyoy_u10,fa_sales5years_u5,sec_financial&amp;ft=2) for this idea, shows that most such banks pay out no more than 3% dividend.

\---

Hi there.

I am currently reading Graham's ""Intelligent Investor"" for the first time. Disclaimer: I am not done reading yet! So far it answers a lot of questions of mine as a newbie investor, but one keeps emerging due to the current situation:

If I understand correctly Graham proposes a 50:50 split between stocks and bonds for the defensive investor (with 25min 75max for each). I try to follow his wisdom and started searching for ""high grade bonds"". Being from Europe - the first thing that came into my mind was German Federal bonds - rock solid, so they must qualify as high grade.

Well, a 10y bond currently pays 0.0% interest and a buy-in now would equate to a slightly net negative investment. Wondering, who would actually buy into this, the only entities I could think of are institutional cash holders that would otherwise be charged heavy negative interests by their banks.

While I am aware that there are corporate bonds etc. - do they really qualify as high grade? since they come with a significant risk, do they not?

Now the questions arise: Am I missing something here? Are there bonds which qualify as high grade but pay a reasonable (read: close to inflation levels) interest? Or am I to take Grahams advice in the sense of ""do divide your portfolio into stocks and something uncorrelated and potentially independent of the stock market"" - in this case I would just leave money on my bank account at 0% interest - right?

When you invest in margin, the stock you intend to buy has a margin requirement and volatility level, how can you know how RH determines these things and when they may change? Is there an independent method to check to see if RH is behaving honestly and with merit with regards to these determinations? I am using RH now, but have noticed margin requirements change but not often. When I used etrade, I would buy stocks and the next day they would often change the margin requirements for various reasons. A stock changing from a determination of high volatility to medium and the margin buying power increasing is very bullish IMO, this is why I want to know.

I ask this question because I have recently went very heavy on SNDL and TLRY with plans to hold a long time and I'm certain the bottom has been bought. Once the volatility has been changed by RH, I expect to see a big increase in the stock price. I am grateful it wasn't allowed when I initially started buying however and it was a reason I chose this stock so heavy so I couldn't overinvest. Sub 60c, I do wish I could buy on margin. TLRY does allow margin and I have used it to buy 1000 shares. If they would reverse the call on volatility, I would most like have to sell some.

What do you think RH would say as to their justification? I have noticed they often don't update things and I think they don't care. The reasons certain news articles are shared with Gold membership imbalanced has been something I have never liked and they disappear as well."|investing|Margin investing, margin requirements, and volatility levels question|0.0|0.4|['Gold']
1641950844.0|0.0|t3_s1tja5|429.0|"I have a taxable brokerage and ROTH IRA with Fidelity.  A Fidelity advisor I met with recently suggested a two things that I am hoping to get some thoughts on.  

1) He said in a taxable account, generally an indexed ETF is more tax efficient than an equivalent indexed mutual fund.  His explanation was that generally the ETF has less distributions than the equivalent mutual fund as as a result you pay less taxes on the ETF's distributions compared to the equivalent mutual fund and reap greater compounded returns over time.  

2)  When it comes to the ROTH IRA, taxable distributions are no longer a concern (I agree)  so he suggested a handful of Fidelity 0% expense ratio mutual funds.  The reason being was that the 0% expense ratio is more beneficial compared to the ETF with a marginal expense ratio.  

I know  everyone has their favorite stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds so I am hoping you can weigh in on the merit of 1 and 2 before reading on the rest.  Point #1 seems legit enough and I have found some research online to substantiate it.  Point #2 is a little more suspect to me as I can understand 0% ER is better than something greater than 0% but I am not sure if he is just trying to peddle Fidelity funds that might not track an index exactly and might not perform as well.  

With all that said, he suggested a handful of iShare ETFs for the brokerage:  IVV (S&amp;P 500) , IJR (Small Cap) , IJH (Mid Cap) , and IVW (S&amp;P 500 Growth) (some simple research showed that these have lower expense ratios than SPY, QQQ, and some of the vanguard equivalents but just with less volume which I guess I am okay with except I was hoping to write some covered called on them from time to time)  

He suggested 3 each  0% Expense Ratio Mutual funds for the ROTH IRA:  FNILX (Large Cap Index) FZILX (International), FZIPX  (Extended Mid to Small Cap Market) 

Thanks for any thoughts or feedback!


Edit and Update:  

Thanks everyone for the overwhelming responses! Summarizing the responses for those just getting to this:   It sounds like for the most part the majority seem to agree that the advice in points 1 and 2 is sound.  Additionally there may be ""transaction fees"" associated with the 0% ER Mutual funds but there is not enough clarity on what those are with respect to other Mutual Funds and I should look at other factors like performance of the funds to make the best decision on if the 0% ER mutual funds are good for me. Finally, the advisor is likley a fiduciary meaning he should be advising in my best interest and that does not mean he can't recommend Fidelity funds and partner funds (iShares are  Blackrock product with an agreement with Fidelity) if he still feels they are best for me."|investing|0% Expense Ratio Mutual Funds Vs Indexed ETFs|429.0|0.94|['IVV', 'Fidelity', 'iShare', 'QQQ', 'Fidelity 0%', 'IJH', 'IVW', 'SPY', 'ROTH', 'IJR', 'ETFs', 'Blackrock', 'FNILX']

TLDR: I have been following Huya for a while and I believe the stock is much undervalued at the moment, since 80%+ of the stock price is made of its net cash position. I believe that the only meaningful risk that could lower the price is the possible delisting, since the stock is listed on the NYSE. 

*Sources: Huya‚Äôs annual report, Huya‚Äôs stock prices and Huya‚Äôs press releases,* [*marketbeat.com*](https://marketbeat.com)

Huya is the leading live streaming platform in China, that is primarily focused on gaming and e-sports live streaming but has also extended its contents to talent shows, anime and outdoor activities.

Stock chart: [https://imgur.com/pIGlRTU](https://imgur.com/pIGlRTU) 

In July 2021 the company announced the termination of the merger agreement with DouYu (the second biggest live streaming platform in China) because of the intervention of the State Administration for Market Regulation. The reason was that Huya and DouYu together would have controlled more than 80% of the market based on active users.

The stock reached its peak in March 2021 (non-considering IPO prices), reaching 36.33$ before starting a steep downtrend, touching its all-time low at 6.08$ the 3rd of December 2021 also due to the strong short positions held on the stock, that reached approx. 30% of the Market Cap (Today‚Äôs market cap is around $ 1.7bn) before decreasing in the recent quarters.

Short Positions trend:  [https://imgur.com/qviqYzU](https://imgur.com/qviqYzU)

Taking into account the 9M21 results (unaudited) and $ 7.50 as Huya‚Äôs stock price the situation is as follow:  [https://imgur.com/zlxP0D9](https://imgur.com/zlxP0D9)

**Aggressive scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short Term investments (short-term wealth management products and money market funds with maturities of less than one year), Short term deposits (interest-bearing bank deposits) and financial liabilities (leases). It this scenario, Huya‚Äôs net cash position is worth $ 7.21 per share (96% of the current price)

**Base scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short Term deposits and financial liabilities (aka leases). It this scenario, Huya‚Äôs net cash position is worth $ 6.55 per share (87%% of the current price).

**Cautions scenario**: we do consider Cash &amp; CE, Short term deposits, short term investments, financial liabilities and operative debts (mostly made of revenue share fees to be paid to content creators). It this scenario, Huya‚Äôs net cash position is worth $ 6.06 per share (81% of the current price), that is the all time low reached by the stock.

That means that you are buying Huya‚Äôs brand, customer base, assets, softwares, and so on, **just for** 68 / 225 / 341 mn $ (**0.29 / 0.95 / 1.74 $ Per share**). **If the company goes bankrupt today, you are going to get almost the same amount of dollars you spend to buy it**.

My idea is that the stock was too hyped before because of the merger, and got really hurt by the government decision (it was the first time the Chinese competition authority stopped a deal). Moreover, a series of headwinds kept the trend bearish (delisting, chinese government against tech stock, see Alibaba, short positions built in the months before) for the rest of the year. At the moment, I don‚Äôt how is it possibile that the stock is worth the same amount of the cash the company has, expecting ZERO growth for the future for a company that is still growing (+30% FY20 vs FY19, 9M21 flat compared to 9M20 that were positively impacted by the pandemic) per year and that is profitable.

I have invested in Huya and I may be biased, that‚Äôs why I want you to tell me why I am wrong, the only headwind that I believe could push the stock lower than these prices is the delisting (Huya is listed on the NYSE), which I consider to be unlikely.

## Intel Drops A Bomb On The Robotaxi Industry

## Summary

* Despite  most investors focusing on Tesla for robotaxis, Intel‚Äôs Mobileye is  currently in volume production of its camera-only L2+ autonomous driving  SuperVision system, beating all competitors to the punch.
* Moreover,  Mobileye announced the world‚Äôs first L4 consumer vehicle, launching in  early 2024. Mobileye has a substantial technology and first-mover  advantage.
* If  Tesla bulls can attribute a $1T market cap to their company‚Äôs  non-existent robotaxis, then initiating Mobileye at a $1T price target  (representing 20x upside) seems reasonable.
* Mobileye could hence become one of the greatest investments of the coming decades.

## Investment Thesis

In a significant bit of news that likely went largely unnoticed by the investment community, not Tesla ([TSLA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Nvidia ([NVDA](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) or anyone else, but actually Intel ([INTC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Mobileye achieved a major milestone in late 2021 by going into volume  production of its camera-only SuperVision autonomous driving system.  Combined with Mobileye's robotaxi business that will start operating in  two international cities in 2022 (based on a camera-based system  combined with a lidar and radar-system), this means autonomous driving  has finally gone from the lab to the fab, and is poised to contribute  billions or even trillions in value to the economy as the technology  gains scale in the coming years and decade(s).

In addition, perhaps the most significant news from CES this week was the [announcement](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.mobileye.com/ces-2022/) of the world's first L4 consumer AV, slated for an early 2024 launch, yet again beating others such as Tesla to the punch.

As  such, Mobileye could become one of the new Big Tech companies as the  backbone of the 21st century autonomous transportation system. Hence, I  initiate Mobileye (which will IPO in mid-2022) at a $1T market cap  target, which could represent 20x upside from its suggested $50B IPO.

## Background

When  people talk about autonomous driving, there is one myth that is often  discussed: the need for compute (measured in TOPS). For that reason,  many investors have pointed to Nvidia as a beneficiary of autonomous  driving. For example, NIO ([NIO](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIO?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  uses 4x Nvidia Orin SoCs in its upcoming ET7 NIO Autonomous Driving  System, for a grand total of 1 POPS (1000 TOPS), combined with over 30  sensors including lidar.

I provide this comparison to give the  reader an impression of just how impressive Mobileye's approach is:  Mobileye's SuperVision, which has gone into production in late 2021 in  the Geely Zeekr 001, leverages just two EyeQ5 SoCs for a grand total of  30 TOPS. Nevertheless, despite having over 30x less compute resources,  Mobileye achieves pretty much exactly the same (or even more advanced)  capabilities as any other car currently in production. Mobileye's system  also uses about 3x less sensors since, similar to Tesla, SuperVision is  completely camera-only (using seven cameras and four parking cameras).

To  be specific, the SuperVision allows for completely hands-free driving  (like a robotaxi or ""full self-driving""). (The reason the system is  nevertheless classified as L2+ is because it isn't validated for the  safety requirements for L4.)

In other words, it really matters  what one does with the compute resources available (the software), and  Mobileye has proven for years that it can do more with less. What this  means is simply that Mobileye's software is much smarter since it can  more effectively make use of the available compute. Mobileye's CTO has  recently [provided a deep dive into the SuperVision system](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGL0z1BULs),  which is worth watching to see the system in action in cities like  Paris and New York City. Note that no other company in the world has  been testing its autonomous driving system in as many locations as  Mobileye, another testament and proof point of Mobileye's ability to  scale its system, which I further detailed previously: [Waymo May Be Disrupted By Its Inability To Scale (NASDAQ:](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/article/4432226-waymo-may-be-disrupted-by-its-inability-to-scale?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)[GOOG](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

## Consumer AVs

SuperVision  is still just a L2+ system: despite being fully capable of autonomous  driving, it has not been validated for the reliability requirements for  the ""holy grail"" L4. So admittedly, it will still take a few years for  autonomous driving to become a reality for consumer: Mobileye is  targeting 2024.

In its L4 system, in order to reach the required  reliability, Mobileye will combine the camera-only SuperVision system  with a second system based on lidar and radar (similar to its approach  in robotaxis). Mobileye has even suggested perhaps there could even be  three subsystems if the lidar and radar are further split into separate  systems, which will become possible due to Mobileye's in-house lidar  (based on Intel's industry-leading silicon photonics) and innovative  high-resolution in-house software-defined radar. Mobileye especially  sees the high-res radar as promising to reduce the cost for affordable  AVs since radar is inherently 5-10x less expensive than lidar.

So  although it could be debated if and to what extent the recent  SuperVision system counts as ""full self-driving"", it nevertheless serves  as a first proof point that autonomous driving has finally gone from  something that perpetually seems five years away, to a tangible  commercial reality.

In any case, Mobileye's grand [announcement](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/zeekr-mobileye-working-together.html%23gs.ld0ya8)  at CES was its very first L4 design win with Geely Zeekr, slated for  early 2024. This system will be based on 8x EyeQ5 SoCs (or about 120  TOPS).

Mobileye further [announced its next-gen SoC](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-tech-news.html%23gs.kr10jb)  for widespread adoption of AVs starting in 2025. The EyeQ Ultra is  touted as Mobileye's AV-on-a-Chip, providing all compute resources in a  single chip. It is one of the most heterogenous chips ever created,  containing CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, FPGAs, VPUs and more.

&gt;At  a mere 176 TOPS, the EyeQ Ultra is much more efficient than other AV  solutions, delivering the necessary performance and price-point required  for consumer-level AVs.

## Robotaxis

In  addition to extending its current industry-leading position in ADAS into  AVs, Mobileye saw several years ago that autonomous driving would first  start with robotaxis, and has likewise been investing to lead this new  industry (as evidenced by the [2020 Moovit acquisition](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346405-intel-distances-from-autonomous-vehicle-competition-1-billion-acquisition?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)  for example). Mobileye has been testing its robotaxis for many years in  Israel, expanded its testing to Munich/Germany in late 2020, and  further expended testing to many other cities in 2021, including in  Detroit, Paris, Asia, Tokyo and New York City.

This will  culminate in the initial robotaxi launch in Tel Aviv and Munich in  mid-2022, which is on schedule to what Mobileye has been saying since  2018 (!). This can't be emphasized enough since in the same time frame,  virtually all of Mobileye's competitors including Google ([GOOG](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) ([GOOGL](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) Waymo, Tesla and GM ([GM](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link))  Cruise have seen delays to their programs. Mobileye is on track to what  it said four years ago, and is targeting an international rollout from  the start (made possible due to Mobileye's unique global mapping  approach as opposed to the legacy geofenced approach).

## ADAS

Mobileye also [announced](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-partner-news.html%23gs.ld14rg) several extended ADAS partnerships at CES, including ones to bring its REM mapping for lane-centering ADAS to Volkswagen ([OTCPK:VWAGY](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWAGY?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) and Ford ([F](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

Mobileye  further announced that it had achieved 41 design wins totalling 50M  units in 2021. For comparison, Mobileye shipped its 100 millionth EyeQ  in late 2021.

## 200PB of data

One oft-heard argument is that supposedly only Tesla has the data and has the Dojo supercomputers. This is false, as [Intel detailed](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-self-driving-secret-data.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;CID=iosm&amp;icid=100002810424702%257Calways-on&amp;linkId=100000101282322%23gs.lg2vve) Mobileye has 200PB of data and 500k CPU cores:

&gt;Mobileye  has spent 25 years collecting and analyzing what we believe to be the  industry's leading database of real-world and simulated driving  experience

## Valuation

Given Mobileye's  nearly flawless execution to its comprehensive vision and strategy,  Mobileye is quickly establishing a tangible leadership position in both  robotaxis and consumer AVs. As such, I would argue that Mobileye  deserves a premium valuation as one of the upcoming new Big Tech  companies.

As such, the sky is the limit. For example, Tesla  investors for years have attributed trillion-dollar valuations to the  company based on the promised (but never delivered) 1 million robotaxis  in 2020. Clearly, not Tesla but Mobileye is now making this premise a  reality.

Investors should note that robotaxis are inherently  poised to be very profitable since they remove virtually all opex costs,  by removing many thousands (if not millions) of drivers from the  (transportation) economy. This will make robotaxis both cheaper and more  profitable than legacy ride-hailing services like Uber ([UBER](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)), Lyft ([LYFT](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LYFT?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)) and DiDi ([DIDI](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIDI?source=content_type:react|section:main_content|button:body_link)).

As  such, there is indeed no reason why Mobileye shouldn't be able to  aspire to this $1 trillion market cap target, which is indeed the target  I initiate Mobileye coverage at.

## Risks

Given Mobileye's  progress on the technology side, which as detailed is now being  translated into numerous commercial deals, the main risk now is  regulation. However, Mobileye has already [said](https://archive.is/o/CUIAS/https://www.timesofisrael.com/mobileye-to-launch-autonomous-taxi-pilot-in-tel-aviv-munich-in-2022/) it is on track to operate its robotaxis in Germany and Israel without safety driver by the end of 2022.

## Investor Takeaway

Although  the Geely Zeekr 001 launch with Mobileye's camera-only autonomous  driving system went largely unnoticed, it represents a significant first  milestone towards the ultimate blue sky vision of an economy based on  driverless transportation, freeing up potentially many millions of jobs.  The value this creates will be immense, and hence Mobileye, as the  leader in driving this revolution, should be valued exactly as such.

The  next milestone is slated in the next few months already with the start  of Mobileye's international robotaxi business. The next milestone after  that will be the completion of Intel's in-house lidar and radar, which  will bring the cost down to levels suitable for mass production in  consumer vehicles. This is targeted for early 2024 (also in partnership  with Geely Zeekr), and will likely be the world's first commercial L4  consumer AV.

Hence, autonomous driving is quickly becoming a  commercial (and profitable) reality, for which the mid-2022 Mobileye IPO  provides investors with potentially one of the best investments for the  coming decades.

Edit 2: Yes Tesla's P/S ratio below could be as low as ~18 if you annualized Q4 sales - although it's a bit weird to do that with sales being cyclical - but I didn't mean to dwell on the current valuation. The point of my post is to talk about longer-term roadblocks to the bull thesis.

Tesla is currently sitting on a P/S ratio nearly at 25.0 (using trailing year data). This is as compared to other mature industrial conglomerates that trade at P/S between 1.0-2.0 (ie Siemans, Northrup). This represents an extreme overstep in share price versus revenue growth: the share price in the last few years has vastly exceeded revenue growth, **meaning the stock has rewarded existing holders with an advance of future growth that has not yet happened**.

Note: I use P/S rather than P/E for comparison because it isn't fair to Tesla to look at their PE as they are heavily investing.

The bull case assumes Tesla will grow revenue into their valuation and even exceed all current expectations. In other words their revenue will increase and eventually when they reach maturity they'll trade at a similar P/S to peers (although possibly on the higher end of the range)

The bull case requires future Tesla revenues exceed 1400% total revenue growth on top of whatever S&amp;P growth is happening **just to keep up with expectations already factored into the share price**. Zero margin for error.

A large part of this revenue growth is expected to come from energy related businesses with $200-$300b+ generally cited by bulls..

What happens if markets/analysts at some point realize Tesla won't be able to grow at their prophesized 50-60% a year, but instead 20-40%? See Cisco circa 2000 for a lesson in what happens when growth expectations drop.

**I don't think Tesla is going to crash this year, not even next year**. Most money flows are short-minded, and investors will need proof of a deceleration. These catalysts will come, probably around 2024/2025...

**Electrifying the grid: the truth**

The biggest bull case for Tesla's valuation as ""not just a car company"" is a grossed up comparison of how much $$ the world currently spends today on coal/gas/oil, and then assuming Tesla will be able to take a large share of this market at high margins.

There's a reason I don't know a single utility analyst that is bullish on Tesla. It's important to understand how regulated utilities work. Utilities, unlike normal companies, do not get paid to sell product or services..instead they get paid indirectly for grid improvement &amp; maintenance.

The way this works:

* A utility first gets approval from their municipality for a project (ie replace a coal plant with wind/solar)
* The utility then generally borrows money via bond or equity issuance to pay for the project.
* The state sets an allowed rate of return the utility can earn on their asset base. If needed, they'll allow an increase in utility rates so that the utility can pay off that loan and earn a reasonable return on top.

Point #3 is the biggest impediment to electrification, and why it will take at least 30 years. Politicians are going to be unwilling to allow energy bills to raise fast enough to do this transition fast. Oh, and with regards to paying for materials, **utilities will go with whatever is cheap**. Cheap low-margin batteries, cheap low-margin solar. Tesla may command some early market dominance, but this is going to fade way to market forces. Utilities will be incentived to keep these costs down.

Unlike Tesla's car business, where folks are willing to pay a premium for a nice car, the battery/solar business has no moat. It's easy for competitors to come in and underbid, and they'll have many years to catch up.

Lets also talk a bit more about moat. Oil has plenty of it with Opec/Russia being run by literal mafias. How about natural gas? In the US - since fracking has become a thing - not so much. See ticker EQT, they are the number one natural gas producer in the US - more natgas production than Exxon - **yet their entire market cap is under $10 billion**. The market capture here isn't anywhere near what bulls are claiming.

**Scaling the company**

Lots of talk has been made as to the potential for Tesla to scale to become a ""giga company"" including into other businesses such as insurance, taxis, etc. Besides the fact that insurance &amp; taxis are low margin businesses and Tesla has no moat in the space, let's talk about scale...

Consider this for a moment. Tesla has currently about 70k employees, many of them highly motivated, and some of the best engineers on the planet.

* How many of those engineers will still be around in 2 years, 5 years? How many are going to retire (rich) once their stock vests (4 year vesting period)?
* How many more employees will Tesla need to hire to scale to a business that sells 10 million cars annual, insurance, taxis, energy? Even with automation we're talking about 100s of thousands of employees.
* What is Tesla? Is Elon Musk Tesla? Or the 70k employees? Will they need to lower the hiring bar as they scale up?
* If the first generation employees were the innovators, the second will have to pick up from the prior group and maintain the company. Will the second generation, third generation engineers be as motivated as the first generation that were able to partake in original share increase?

Purpose of the above is to help folks understand *the Tesla of 2030 will organizationally bear no resemblance to that of 2022*. Literally all the surviving dotcom companies that sit atop NASDAQ today struggled with this originally. Consider all the failed Google or Microsoft ventures.

For Tesla to become a $3 trillion dollar company, it can't be the Elon show. For reference though, **Tesla currently has the worst glassdoor reviews out of any company in the VTI top 10** (3.7/5.0), just barely below Amazon's 3.8 with 1+ million employees. This is despite the fact many Tesla employees have shared in the wealth thanks to stock grants. They are known to overwork their folks. This isn't a good sign for a company that still needs to scale at least 5-fold in hiring.

Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values cut in half from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at Sundial Capital Research.

‚ÄúWhatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,‚Äù Goepfert said in a note.

Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-com bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak.

‚ÄúValuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,‚Äù Goepfert said. ‚ÄúAll of these are scaring investors that we‚Äôre on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.‚Äù

Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that‚Äôs driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs last policy meeting ‚Äî released on Wednesday ‚Äî pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.

So for the last couple years I have been using Northwest Mutual as my investment group. I had a financial advisor who helped me get on the right track. After a bit of discussion and thought with my wife and some others, I decided to go ahead and shift my investments over to Vanguard to cut out extra fees (and pressure to do certain things that do not align with my goals I.e. whole life) 

I have done plenty of research in the past about vanguard and I loved it for the sake that it was overall very well run (from what I could see and general returns over time) and more importantly, it was one of the lowest in terms of fees. 

I am really in a simple position at this point of my investment growth

1. Maxing out my ROTH each year
2. Slowly adding to an investment account I am building for retirement
3. Working on building my emergency fund along with extra for a down payment on a larger house.

So really I will have two funds with Vanguard. My issue, which I would love some assistance with, is two fold...

1. I am having a terrible time navigating their website. I can't even find the simple search engine to check out other funds without just googling it and going direct. Can anyone help explain or know of a decent guide?
2. Trying to find out which funds I should go into. Having transferred my funds over from a Non-Vanguard fund, if I am correct, I have to sell the funds to purchase a new fund. So since I will get hit on fees id like to make this a one time thing haha. To be clear, I am not looking for anyone to tell me what to put the money into, but figure out which ones are for ROTH's if there are specific ones, or if I just need to choose ones that align with my risk tolerance like an index fund.

&gt;Investors  have been preparing for the Federal Reserve to start hiking interest  rates. They also know the central bank is cutting the amount of bonds it  buys each month. On top of that, they figured, eventually, the tapering  would lead to a reduction in the nearly $9 trillion in assets the Fed  is holding.  
&gt;  
&gt;What they didn't expect were all three things happening at the same time.  
&gt;  
&gt;But [minutes from the Fed's December meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html), released Wednesday, indicated that may well be the case.  
&gt;  
&gt;The [meeting summary](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)  showed members ready to not only start raising interest rates and  tapering bond buying, but also being prepared to engage in a high-level  conversations about reducing holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed  securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the moves are designed to fight inflation and as the jobs market heals, the jolt of a Fed triple threat of tightening [sent the market into a tailspin](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)  Wednesday. The result saw stocks give back their Santa Claus rally  gains and then some as the prospect of a hawkish central bank cast a  haze of uncertainty over the investing landscape.  
&gt;  
&gt;Markets [were mixed Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html) as investors tried to figure out the central bank's intentions.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The  reason the market had a knee-jerk reaction yesterday was it sounds like  the Fed is going to come fast and furious and take liquidity out of the  market,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief market strategist at Ally Financial.  ""If they do it in a steady and gradual manner, the market can perform  well in that environment. If they come fast and furious, then it's going  to be a different story.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed officials said during the meeting  that they remain data-dependent and will be sure to communicate their  intentions clearly to the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still, the prospect of a much  more aggressive Fed was cause for worry after nearly two years of the  most accommodative monetary policy in U.S. history.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bell  said investors are likely worrying too much about policy from officials  who have been clear that they don't want to do anything to slow the  recovery or to tank financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Fed sounds like  they're going to be a lot quicker in action,"" she said. ""But the reality  is we don't honestly know how they're going to move and when they're  going to move. That's going to be determined over the next several  months.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Clues coming soon  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed, the market won't have to wait long to hear where the Fed is headed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Multiple  Fed speakers already have weighed in over the past couple days, with  Governor Christopher Waller and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  taking a more aggressive tone. Meanwhile, San Francisco Fed President  Mary Daly said Thursday she thinks the start of balance sheet reduction  isn't necessarily imminent.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chairman [Jerome Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/)  will speak next week during his confirmation hearing, and a second time  this month following the Fed meeting on Jan. 25-26, when he may strike a  more dovish tone, said Michael Yoshikami, founder and chairman of  Destination Wealth Management.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro:  
&gt;  
&gt;One big factor Yoshikami sees is that while the Fed is [determined to fight inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/wholesale-prices-measure-rises-9point6percent-in-november-from-a-year-ago-the-fastest-pace-on-record.html), it also will have to deal with the negative impact of the omicron variant.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I  expect the Fed to come out and say everything is based on the pandemic  blowing over. But if omicron really does continue to be a problem for  the next 30 or 45 days, it is going to impact the economy and might  cause us to delay raising rates,"" he said. ""I expect that commentary to  come out in the next 30 days.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond that, there are some certainties about policy: The market knows, for instance, that the Fed starting in January [will be buying just $60 billion of bonds](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/fed-will-aggressively-dial-back-its-monthly-bond-buying-sees-three-rate-hikes-next-year.html) each month ‚Äî half the level it had been purchasing just a few months ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed  officials in December also had penciled in three  quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year after previously  indicating just one, and markets are pricing in close to a 50-50 chance  of a fourth hike. Also, Powell had indicated that there was discussion  about balance sheet reduction at the meeting, though he seemed to play  down how deeply his colleagues delved into the topic.  
&gt;  
&gt;So what the  market doesn't know right now is how aggressive the Fed will be reducing  its balance sheet. It's an important issue for investors as central  bank liquidity has helped underpin markets during the Covid tumult.  
&gt;  
&gt;During the [last balance sheet unwind](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/fed-approves-october-reversal-of-historic-stimulus-leaves-rates-unchanged.html),  from 2017 until 2019, the Fed allowed a capped level of proceeds from  its bond portfolio to run off. The cap started at $10 billion each  month, then increased by $10 billion quarterly until they reached $50  billion. By the time the Fed had to retreat, it had run off just $600  billion from what had been a $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the  balance sheet now approaching $9 trillion ‚Äî $8.3 trillion of which is  comprised of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has  been buying ‚Äî the initial view from Wall Street is that the Fed could be  more aggressive this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Uncharted waters'  
&gt;  
&gt;Estimates  bandied about following Wednesday's news ranged from maximum caps of  $100 billion from JPMorgan Chase to $60 billion at Nomura. Fed officials  have not specified any numbers yet, with Kashkari earlier this week  only saying that he sees the end of the runoff still leaving the Fed  with a large balance sheet, probably bigger than before Covid.  
&gt;  
&gt;One  other possibility is that the Fed could sell assets outright, said  Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;There  would be multiple reasons for the central bank to do so, particularly  with long-dated interest rates so low, the Fed's bond profile being  relatively long in duration and the sheer size of the balance sheet ‚Äî  almost twice what it was last time around.  
&gt;  
&gt;""While longer term  yields have rebounded in recent days, if they were to remain stubbornly  low and the Fed is faced with a rapidly flattening yield curve, we think  there would be a good case that the Fed should supplement its balance  sheet runoff with outright sales of longer-dated Treasury securities and  MBS,"" Pearce said in a note to clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;That leaves investors with a multitude of possibilities that could make navigating the 2022 landscape difficult.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  that last tightening cycle, the Fed waited from the first hike before  it started cutting the balance sheet. This time, policymakers seem  determined to get things moving more quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Markets are  concerned that we've never seen the Federal Reserve both lift interest  rates off zero and reduce the size of its balance sheet at the same  time. There was a two-year gap between those two events in the last  cycle, so it is a valid concern. Our advice is to invest/trade very  carefully the next few days,"" DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas said in his  daily note Wednesday evening.

We've all noticed the market dip over the past few days and, knowing that money doesn't simply disappear from existance (fiat debt repayments aside), I'm trying to piece together where the money is going. 

First I saw that crypto was being slayed on all fronts. Then I saw that equities were also being slayed, but then I've also noticed that gold and silver too are dipping. Finally the 10 year note rates are increasing (suggesting a lack of interest in them).

Where else haven't I looked? What is spiking proportionally to the dip?

It's not inconceivable that the money (from selling) is simply being held in accounts, but I find that unlikely given its fiat, inflationary nature.

Perhaps the money has been used to pay off loans that themselves were simply printed into existence - thus the money would cease to exist (deflation). But I doubt this.

Thanks for reading my ramblings. I'm no Economist, just trying to work out where the money is going...

Your analysis suggests you should want to be bearish the S&amp;P500. You are pretty (\*\*extremely\*\*) sure it‚Äôs going down. Here is some information you might want to know before you take that bet.

In each 10-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher one day ten is 62%.

**But‚Ä¶ the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 88.82%. Let‚Äôs dig deeper. (**Data source: [Tradewell](https://tradewell.app))

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO](https://imgur.com/a/5PoiFuO) (Source: Tradewell)

The chart above shows every single 10-day return period for the S&amp;P500 ETF, the $SPY, since its inception.

The blue lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY closed higher at least once.

The red lines show every single 10-day return period where the $SPY did \*not\* close higher at least once, ie. T\[0\] was the highest price the $SPY traded over the next 10 days.

If it‚Äôs not already obvious there are **a lot** bluer lines than there are red lines. In each of the charts shown below the red lines will depict price paths that did not close higher at least once.

The same applies on a 15 and 20 day-timeframes:

* \- In each 15-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 15 is 64% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 91.53%.
* \- In each 20-day period the $SPY historical probability of closing higher on day 20 is 65% and the probability that it closes higher from time 0 in at least one of those days is 93%.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT](https://imgur.com/gallery/u5asngT) (Source: Tradewell)

And how about in a 60-day period. Historically, 97% of the time the SPY has closed higher at least once over the next 60 trading days. \*\*Incredible\*\*.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY](https://imgur.com/a/s5fwzZY) (Source: Tradewell)

So, what are the obvious and not-so obvious takeaways from this:

1. The S&amp;P500 has a natural upside drift on virtually every time frame the SPY has well over a 50% chance of closing higher than where it started.
2. The price path the SPY takes to its destination has a lot of new highs from the starting point. In each of the 10, 15, 20 and 60 day timeframes the $SPY has historically had a probability of closing higher at least once 89%, 92%, 93%, and 97% of the time respectively.

With the majority of stocks getting annihilated in Q4 (disregarding the majority of mega-cap, of course) and the Fed basically signaling they will be raising rates several times this year, with a starting target date around March I believe, I think now might be a good time to open some 6-month call options on stocks that have been beaten down in the Fintech space as well as some large-cap stocks sitting near critical support.  We have earnings season coming up starting in the next few weeks and running until March or so and the following stocks typically like to run during times like these.  

\*Fintech\*

UPST - 7/15 200C - Has taken a massive beating nearly 70% off highs.  They are trying to get into the auto loan business and have other potential catalysts (partnerships) around the corner.  Momentum stock that can run hard with Fintech coming back on the scene, especially at these low entry points with institutions that got out at the top.  Looking for entry around $110-120.

AFRM - 6/17 100C - Another one that has been sold off and shorted to oblivion hovering around $80 from highs at $160.  Have a feeling a reversal is coming soon and that this could ride on the shoulders of SQ, PYPL, COIN, etc.  Looking or an entry around $75.

\*Semis\*

NVDA - 6/17 280C - Trading in the range of 280-320 for the last couple of months.  Top growth stock on everyone's mind that has tons of potential catalysts and one that is going to be a leader in the Metaverse movement, which I believe as a whole will start to take off this year.  P/E and such are high but NVDA is solidifying its stance as a stock that retail and institutions just can't ignore.  No one doubts that this is an amazing company that will be a market leader, however, currently, it is a mega-cap momentum stock that is selling off and shorted due to a flat/downtrend in QQQ's.  NVDA is notorious for running hard into earnings and with a blowout quarter (which they typically have) and more price target upgrades, I can see this hitting 350 well before summer.  Looking for an entry around $250-260.

AMD - 6/17 150C - Similar ideas to NVDA with the semiconductors still running this year.  Chip shortage should begin easing in Q1/Q2 and with the Metaverse taking off as well as the upcoming acquisition of XLNX which has been pushed to Q1, I see AMD as being a leader in this space.  Volume has been hovering around 50M, and I anticipate it to increase with the above catalysts taking off and the QQQ's breaking out of their sideways trend.  Looking for an entry around $125-130.

From time to time, Warren Buffett often references various aspects of investing that he learned while under the wings of Graham. According to Buffett himself, the one analogy he found to be the most useful from Graham's book - ""The Intelligent Investor"" is the concept of Mr. Market. 

According to Graham, the stock market is a salesman that comes and offers you various quotes on the securities that you own. If he is feeling great that day, he might give you an amazing offer. If not, he might give you a lowball offer. The point is - you should never let the salesman's offer persuade you into thinking that your security is somehow more or less valuable. At the end of the day, the securities that you own have an intrinsic value and you should only do business with Mr. Market when it is favorable for you. 

From Benjamin Graham himself:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe intelligent investor shouldn‚Äôt ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead, you should do business with him- but only to the extent that it serves your interests.‚Äù 

In these turbulent times in the market, it is important to recognize that simply because the market is up or down doesn't mean that your company's intrinsic value somehow changed. It is simply what the salesman is offering you today. Instead, you should be looking deeper into your company's revenue growth, valuation multiples, and other fundamental factors and whether your thesis around that has changed. 

The mood of Mr. Market will often open up amazing opportunities in the equity market. In 10 years from now, we will be looking at many companies and saying ""wish we had bought it in 2022"". Don't let Mr. Market fool you.

Some background: I am mid-20's, work in the industry, and am currently studying for CFA Level 3 so I have been gaining more and more knowledge on asset allocation. This portfolio is designed to be long term.

Current portfolio is 55% IEF (7-10 yr Treasuries), 35% UPRO (3x S&amp;P), 10% SPY benchmarked to the S&amp;P 500. Essentially the portfolio is 115% S&amp;P and 55% IEF (I know UPRO gives 3x daily return so exposure is not always exactly 115%). This portfolio has performed well since 2009 beating the S&amp;P by 2-3% annually. However, that period was generally a period of falling interest rates so IEF performed well along with the S&amp;P. Regardless, I think IEF will still keep a low correlation with the market and give some diversification going forward with rising rates. Overall, this is obviously not a completely diversified portfolio and that's where I get a bit uncomfortable. I'd like to add international and small-mid cap exposure for diversification, however, it's tough when performance has been so good over the last few years (I know this will not continue forever).

A change I'm considering would be to lower the IEF and UPRO allocation and add an allocation to VEA (developed Int'l), IJH (mid caps), and IJR (small caps). Could look something like 20% UPRO, 20% SPY, 20% VEA, 10% IJH, 5% IJR, and 25% IEF (not exact, just throwing some numbers out there). The backtest on this does not look as good, however, I know that US large caps cannot stay in the lead forever and given this is a long term portfolio, this could be the better option moving forward.

For me, I'm fine matching the S&amp;P 500 returns long term even if they underperform other asset classes for certain time periods. This is another reason I am in the current portfolio.

1641420170.0|0.0|t3_rwxyzn|42.0|"&gt;(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Once upon a time, Goldilocks saw inflation at 6.8% and knew the Federal  Reserve would have to act. Worried about the value of her home and  stock portfolio, she visited the Fed house. First, she saw Papa Fed Bear  who was big and scary. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a bubble. I‚Äôm going to cause asset  prices to crash, especially stock and real estate prices. Interest rates  and the cost of capital will soar, leading to bankruptcies and major  recession. Only after a major purge can healthy economic growth resume.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Next  Goldilocks met Baby Fed Bear, who was small and cute. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt hurt  your portfolio Goldilocks. I‚Äôll just do a little cosmetic tightening and  pull back at any sign of market unease or complaints from elected  officials. The main thing is not to disrupt the economic healing from  the pandemic.‚Äù But Goldilocks knew that was as scary as Papa Fed Bear. A  timid, politicized Fed in the 1970s managed to drag down the economy  without taming inflation, leading to stagflation and perverse government  policies like wage and price controls.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally,  Goldilocks found Mama Fed Bear. She promised firm tightening to deflate  bubbles, clear out economic deadwood and limit inflation to 2%, while  keeping real economic growth at least positive for the next year and  setting the stage for years of robust growth afterward. ‚ÄúLet the  politicians yell and scream, let the markets beg for mercy, I will hold a  steady, independent course based on good data, firm theory and  battle-tested models.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;I  don‚Äôt know which of the three Fed Bears will show up in 2022, but all  three are plausible enough that investors should diversify so none can  cause fatal financial damage. Just as important, decisions should not be  made on fairy tales but by sober consideration of the probabilities and  likely magnitudes of the three scenarios.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  median forecast for 2022 seems to be that the Fed ends asset purchases  early in 2022, and raises its target for the federal funds rate three  times, or by 0.75 percentage point. Since 1954, the real total return on  the S&amp;P 500 Index -- including dividends but after inflation -- has  been 3% in years when the fed funds target rate rises by 0.75  percentage point or more, versus 10% in other years. The chance of a 10%  real decline is 21% in those years and a Papa Fed Bear 20% decline  happens 8% of the time. Those are twice the 11% and 4% probabilities in  years when the Fed does not raise the fed funds rate by 0.75 percentage  point or more.¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;While  a 3% average real return is not bad, for many investors it might not be  worth the 16% volatility and the doubled crash risk of Fed tightening  years. Moreover, 0.75 percentage point is only the median forecast, and  there‚Äôs a good chance the Fed will be forced into more aggressive action  with correspondingly larger effects on asset prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Optimistic  investors are conditioned to think that poor market returns set the  stage for future growth. But if we look at the average annualized total  S&amp;P 500 returns for the five years after a year in which the Fed  tightens by 0.75 percentage point or more, they are somewhat worse ‚Äî  5.4% annualized versus 6.7% ‚Äî than five-year periods following years  without 0.75 percentage point or more tightening.  
&gt;  
&gt;What  about the Baby Fed Bear scenario? What if the inflation rate remains  above 6% for all 12 months of 2022? That‚Äôs just as bad for average stock  market returns as Fed increases of 0.75 percentage point or more ‚Äî a 3%  average total real return for the S&amp;P 500. But despite the low  average returns, these years have sharply reduced volatility and crash  risk. Only 5% of the time is the S&amp;P 500 real total return worse  than minus 10%, versus 13% in other years ‚Äî and only 0.4% of the time is  it a 20% or greater decline, versus 5% in other years. In the  subsequent five years, investors enjoy an average 9.1% annualized real  total return, versus 6.2% in other years. So, stock market investors  need not fear Baby Fed Bear, despite the painful experience of the  1970s.  
&gt;  
&gt;Averages  from the past are not predictions of the future. Their use is in  calibrating diversification. Your portfolio and financial plan should be  capable of withstanding the full range of historical events if they are  to have any hope of surviving what actually happens. Guessing the  future can produce above-average returns, but prudent investors plan for  being wrong as well as for being right.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  2022, median forecasts and historical averages identify Papa Fed Bear  as a major risk to asset prices. Expected real returns may be positive,  but they‚Äôre modest, and crash risks seem to be about double their  average level. Even five-year real return expectations seem reduced.  That‚Äôs not a reason to flee stocks and other assets, but it‚Äôs a reason  prepare for bad news and to be sure your allocations reflect your true  risk tolerance. If you can find cost-effective tail-risk hedges, they  may be more attractive than average.  
&gt;  
&gt;On  the other hand, most economists and commentators seem more concerned  about Baby Fed Bear. They may be correct from the standpoint of  long-term societal consequences, but the damage to investors would  likely be in below-average asset real returns, rather than in high  volatility or crash risk; and the five-year prospects would be quite  good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of  course, we all hope for Mama Fed Bear to cure our inflation, bubble and  overleverage problems with a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go  down. My¬†guess is that‚Äôs unlikely without progress on fiscal issues‚Äînot  so much cutting spending and increasing taxes as moving from ideological  brinksmanship to rational budgeting with honest numbers.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  most versions of the fairy tale, Goldilocks runs away from all three  bears to the safety of her mother‚Äôs arms. She promises to be good and  give up housebreaking and stealing food from wild animals. But there‚Äôs  no running away from the three Fed Bears.

The transcript for the minutes can be found here -  [The Fed - Monetary Policy: (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20211215.htm)

If you read the minutes, there are discussions about Fed's balance sheet reduction and hints that interest rates may be raised sooner than initially believed by the market.

Excerpt from minutes "" Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate. Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures. ""

Now they're getting it. It was intensely obvious to me that Intel was extremely undervalued at 9-10x PE as a key provider in the growing cloud and edge space already, and even a moderately successful GPU lineup could add billions of dollars of growth to the company.

Still looks cheap af to me, and it provides a yield. I'm going to keep getting it here, I think 2023 will be a big year for them. 

Look at Microsoft and Satya to see how a good CEO can turn around a company full of smart people that were just mismanaged for a while.

I have fairly high confidence (80%) that most of these names will be long term successes, many of them have NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED at all. I lack the experience in the market to determine if I should sell or not, my only concern is that growth could see a decade downturn.

Some of the names:

CMBM Cambium networks -45% - These guys make top of the line 5g radios. They are having supply chain constraints but demand is extremely high, they are forecasting the supply chain to ease up within the year.

RGEN Repligen corp +10% - this one hurts, I was over 50% up at one point. Biotech. Nothing has changed. Stronge M+A, good pipeline.

NCNO nCino -31% - The industry leader in cloud banking serving large names (like UBS). The only cloud banking platform that offers a full suite of products (customers need not use multiple service providers). High P/S ratio... but I am confident in the growth. Very strong culture and great leadership.

TCNNF Truelieve Cannabis Corp -34% - This is the only cannabis name worth investing in in my eye. They have seen explosive growth and open new stores literally every month. They have expanded into 2 new states in 2021, product is top rated, stores look like apple stores, and they have a monopoly on florida. Some unrelated drama with the CEO's husband caused a downturn in the stock that stuck around.

AYX Alteryx -23% - Anther high P/s growth name. These guys make a top of the line SaaS data processing tool, different than tableau. Idk what else to say, data is just getting more and more important. Ive had some issues with what management is doing but once their cloud product comes out I think things will turn around.

From there, the tool would keep track of how you portfolio deviates from the index, and what actions(buy/sell) are needed to track the index(or your version of the index).


This would address a number of issues with Index funds:

- Dividends would hit your account when they are paid, rather than quarterly from the ETF, allowing them to be reinvested sooner

- You can exclude companies you don't like, either for fundamental or moral reasons(ie maybe you want a high dividend index, but want to exclude Philip Morris because you don't want to profit off of tobacco).

- You can exercise tax loss harvesting by selling losing stocks, which isn't possible with an index

- Because you own the stock directly, you don't have to worry about a huge tax bill or time out of the market if the index fund decides to close down.

- Mutual funds and ETFs do not grant you voting rights to the shares they hold for you, but if you buy directly, you do have rights."|investing|"Would anyone be interested in a tool that lets you create a ""custom index""? Or does one exist?"|165.0|0.87|['Philip Morris']

Last week I paid for a Lifetime Membership to Rick Rahim's ProChartSignals.com ($1,699). It was supposed to include custom signal indicators, lots of educational material, information from Rick on how his bots are setup so we could do the same, free forex trading bots and other benefits shown on his site. (It has been edited recently, but I've taken screenshots of its original promises).

Anyways, the value add of having all the info and data immediately available plus a person to help learn helped me justify the cost. 

Instead it was QQE Buy/Sell signals Rick stole from Trading View and rebranded, as well as the Awesome Oscillator. His lifetime member discord is just him calling out his stock trades and answering only the questions that lead to him making more money off the members, because the once free forex bots are now only free for the first 45 days, and hosted on FXPrimary, a forex site with loads of bad history. 

About a week after joining I was promptly banned for bringing up his obvious theft of signals from trading view. 

Apparently this kind of stuff isn't uncommon, although it's usually a $25/month discord fee for call outs. Many of which have the same win percent because they're based off of free TV signals.

My long winded point here is that you're better off just taking the time to learn opposed to believing there's a shortcut to profit."|investing|Avoid Paid Signal &amp; Bots Services - esp Rick Rahim|585.0|0.93|['QQE Buy/Sell', 'the Awesome Oscillator', 'FXPrimary', 'Trading View']

I‚Äôm a 27 year old who just started contributing to a Roth IRA in March of 2021. I make enough to max out my Roth every year and save some on the side in an individual brokerage account (currently approx $12K in Roth and $7K in individual with consistent disbursements to individual account)

Up until now I‚Äôve used my Roth to hold all of my long term assets and have used my individual brokerage account for my ‚Äúswing‚Äù trading. I say ‚Äúswing‚Äù because I trade individual companies based on trends and never hold any for more than a year, so I never take advantage of ‚Äúlong term‚Äù assets. 

Is it smart to invert this strategy and utilize the fact that Roth IRAs don‚Äôt get hit with taxes on every trade to swing trade in my Roth and use my individual brokerage account for my long term (ETFs and indexes) trades?

1641193602.0|0.0|t3_ruvpai|2.0|"I recently finished reading Out of the Crisis - byline ""The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education"", by W. Edwards Deming, originally published in 1982 but updated in '86.

For those who don't know, Deming was an American who brought Quality to Japan after WW2. Things often credited to the Japanese industry, such as the Toyota Production Model, just-in-time, etc., can be traced back to the conceptual seeds he planted in exchanges with leaders of Japanese industry in 1950. The American Society of Quality has a nice short biographical write-up on him.

Deming presents his common diseases of management - applicable to any manufacturing or service industry - with heavy emphasis on management responsibility. The reason for this is that management can only change the company's system, and the company's system is by far the overwhelming driver of employee productivity. He specifically quantifies (by experienced estimate) that ""most troubles and most possibilities for improvement add up to proportions something like this: 94% belong to the system (responsibility of management)\[,\] 6% special"" (ch. 11, ""Common Causes and Special Causes of Improvement. Stable System"").

This struck me being very similar to the argument against actively managed portfolios: take 100 active portfolio managers working for a decade, and some of them will beat indices primarily by luck; but the success of the best managers in this group will be erroneously attributed to their personal touch (""special cause""). When in reality, the reason for their success belongs primarily to the system (""common cause""). So the recognition of this myth of the active investor who by their own special touch consistently beats indices has rightly given rise to the popularity of index investing, and with it removed an inefficiency from a great many investment portfolios.

A fun illustration of common causes attributable to the system nevertheless being attributed to individual employees (either as accolades for high performance or admonishment for low performance), the book introduces the red bead experiment, a simulation that can be done with 10 volunteers. It's well illustrated by an industrial engineering professor in [this short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiC4UgpDyw).

What else really struck me was Deming's wealth of insights, quotes, and stores regarding the common diseases of management. As an index investor, as well as having worked in technical service industries, I both experience and see the effects of these diseases, and if my experience is any indicator, these diseases are likely a common cause across many companies that passive index funds invest in, which concerns me because this would then be a common weakness to an overall index portfolio. Here's but two of the deadly diseases, which ultimately represent inefficiencies leading to waste, increased costs, and lower profits:

&gt; 3. Evaluation of performance, merit rating, or annual review.
&gt; [...] It nourishes short-term performance, annihilates long term planning, builds fear, demolishes teamwork, nourishes rivalry and politics.

&gt; 5. Management by use only of visible figures, with little or no consideration of figures that are unknown or unknowable.
&gt; [...] Actually, the most important figures that one needs for management are unknown or unknowable (Lloyd S. Nelson, p. 20), but successful management must nevertheless take account of them. Examples: 1. The multiplying effect on sales that comes from a happy customer, and the opposite effect from an unhappy customer.

Finally, something to challenge this current notion that this period of relatively increased inflation will continue into the long-term. How much waste is embedded in the goods and services we buy? The good news here is that index investors stand to benefit from any gradual pan-industry reduction in waste (materials and person-hours). Deming argues against the common wisdom that cost and quality are zero-sum. Think of the often-quoted project management triangle: you can only pick two of: cost, quality, and time. Not necessarily always true! In reality, higher quality can drive down \*total\* cost. From the opening of Chapter 1:

&gt; Folklore has it in America that quality and production are incompatible: that you can not have both. A plant manager will usually tell you that it is either or. In his experience, if he pushes quality, he falls behind in production. If he pushes production, his quality suffers. This will be his experience when he knows not what quality is nor how to achieve it. A clear, concise answer came forth in a meeting with 22 production workers, all union representatives, in response to my question:
&gt; ‚ÄúWhy is it that productivity increases as quality improves?‚Äù
&gt; Less rework.
&gt; There is no better answer. Another version often comes forth:
&gt; Not so much waste.
&gt; Quality to the production worker means that his performance satisfies him, provides to him pride of workmanship. Improvement of quality transfers waste of man-hours and of machine-time into the manufacture of good product and better service. The result is a chain reaction‚Äîlower costs, better competitive position, happier people on the job, jobs, and more jobs.

In conclusion, to be an index investor is to believe in the sustained growth and profitability over a long time horizon. I'm a believer in this because there is so much more room for improvement in the management of corporations. I am optimistic that this is gradually happening."|investing|W.

&gt;Evergrande has more than $300bn (¬£222bn) of debts and is scrambling to raise cash by selling assets and shares to repay suppliers and creditors.

&gt;Last week, the company dialled back plans to repay investors in its wealth management products.

&gt;The company had earlier not mentioned any amount and had agreed to repay 10% of the investment by the end of the month when the product matures.

&gt;Evergrande said in a statement posted on the wealth unit's website that the situation was not ""ideal"" and that it would ""actively raise funds"", and update the repayment plan in late March, without giving further details.

&gt;The announcement was seen as highlighting the deepening cash squeeze at the struggling property developer.

&gt;Last week, Evergrande did not make some interest payments on its offshore bonds.

After a rocky 2020 for the entire auto industry, electric vehicle sales rebounded in 2021 amid high demand for vehicles and a shortage of actual cars to buy. Tesla, to be fair, never really suffered the way many traditional automakers did. The EV-maker led by CEO Elon Musk found ways to keep vehicle deliveries at steady, record levels even as chip shortages caused some automakers to cut production goals.

Part of that, of course, comes because Tesla's overall volume -- while steadily growing -- remains much smaller than the higher-volume traditional automakers. But, it's a tribute to the company's innovation that it managed to grow despite a global chip shortage that impacted the entire auto industry.

EV rivals NIO and Lucid are in a much earlier phase of their journeys, but all three companies have major plans for 2022.

## What Will Tesla Do in 2022 (and Beyond) ?

In the coming year Tesla will expand its capacity as new factories come online. The EV leader now has four factories online -- Fremont, Shanghai, Austin, and Berlin. CFO Zach Kirkhorn laid out where the company stands and where it's going in his remarks during the company's[ Q3 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/21/tesla-tsla-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/) with investors.

""Over the last 12 months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know in the factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another 50%,"" he said. ""I think that will be a difficult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they're going to continue to push on that.""

Tesla has ambitious plans to grow how many vehicles it can produce, according to its CFO.

""You know, we're trying to get to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can,"" he said. ""And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentially even getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here in Austin and continue to grow from there. So, you know, our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year.""

## Lucid Looks to Ramp Up in 2022

Lucid delivered its first vehicles in the third quarter of 2021. The company plans to increase that in the coming year by closing out this one strong. The company has added 2.85 million square feet to its Arizona manufacturing plant. It plans to have 20 studios and service centers open by the end of this year.

""So you can see acceleration as a theme in the second half of 2021,"" CEO Peter Rawlinson said during the [Q3 earnings call](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4469784-lucid-group-inc-lcid-ceo-peter-rawlinson-on-q3-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript). ""We also continue to increase our service footprint across the U.S., not just with physical service centers but also with the roll-out of our mobile service program. We expect service centers to continue opening in North America and we anticipate hiring a significant number of additional service technicians as we expand our capabilities.""

Lucid plans to be able to sell more vehicles in 2022, Those goals include expanding beyond the U.S.

""Lucid continues to grow its operations in the U.S. but as part of our growth strategy, and more specifically, our international strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance, repair services, and manufacturing activities outside of the U.S.,"" according to Rawlinson. "" ...On the retail and service front, we're looking to expand our footprint in Europe and the Middle East, and we expect to enter these markets in 2022.""

A Chinese EV company, NIO has [made some moves](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-rival-nio-reportedly-prepares-for-u-s-entry-ramps-up-hiring), including listing a number of jobs, that suggest it plans to enter the U.S. market in 2022. The company also said that it will enter Germany, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden in 2022, and reach 25 countries by 2025, at its annual Nio Day event.

Nio delivered 24,439 vehicles in the third quarter of 2021. That roughly doubled its total from the previous year. The company closed the year with over $7 billion on its balance sheet. It expects to deliver between ""23,500 and 25,500 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 35.4% to 46.9% from the same quarter of 2020,"" the company said in its Q3 earnings report.

""Despite the continued supply chain volatilities, our teams and partners are working closely together to secure the supply and production for the fourth quarter of 2021,"" said CEO William Bin Li in the earnings report. ""Meanwhile, we are fully dedicated to accelerating our products and technologies development and bringing the three new products based on NIO Technology Platform 2.0 to users in 2022 to lead the smart EV transformation and adoption.""

This post is intended to spark a healthy discussion around using governmental student loans for investment purposes.

To give you some context. We are NOT talking about an American student loan but an European loan:

1) The interest rate will be 0,01%. Nowhere near the insane predatory rates of my American counterparts.
2) We are talking about max ‚Ç¨ 20k in loans i.e ~ 1000 euro loan per month for 2 years.
3) The repayment program will start two years after the lending stops or post graduation. The repayment per month is 0,45% of total debt per month. Which equals to 90 euros a months
4) You would be 4 years in the stock market before the repayment even starts. It will be meant for long term investing
5) Even if the loan will not be used directly for investment, you would still profit by putting it into a cash bank account with 0,4% interest rate. Therefore a person could wait for a sip the dip during a market crash and pay the monthlies with regular income. Or choose to pay it back entirely
6) The euro inflation of &gt;5,0% alone will eat away the debt.
7) This is not illegal in this country since this specific loan is not intended to pay for college tuition as an example. Ethical concerns is up for debate
8) you could call it leverage but it is no margin. Nobody will margin call if the investment drops in price. 

So you have two options. Either start investing directly and put the loan into an ETF. You may profit or not or just let it sit in your bank and decide to buy the dip or pay it bank instantly with no loss or profit."|investing|Investing borrowed money with 0,01% interest rate|1.0|0.54|[]

According to Buffett, he believed that he is an intelligent investor because he has the patience to be inactive. While most managers and asset allocators are trading their winners because it has gone up a lot or because it has become too large of a portion of the fund, Buffett simply holds and lets his winners ride. 

The analogy that Buffett used was one from basketball. From Buffett: 

&gt; To suggest that this investor should sell off portions of his most successful investments simply because they have come to dominate his portfolio is akin to suggesting that the Bulls trade Michael Jordan because he has become so important to the team. 

It seems that Cathie Wood is falling prey to this exact problem. She is selling her winner in $TSLA to buy other beaten down stocks because they have some form of innovation or potential that the market is currently missing. This approach works...until it doesn't.

I'm here to make the counter argument that we're about to embark on another roaring '20s so buckle up buckaroo.

First off, this is not financial advice so do your own research and don't listen to random people on the internet. Second, I'm speaking about the US economy but the world's economy more or less follows the US economy so deal with it.

Now we got that out of the way, let's take a look back. The Great Recession 2007-2008 mainly brought on by over leveraging the housing market brought us quantitative easing and an opening of the flood gates of government spending. It took years to recover but we came out of it with very low interest rates, a heavy FED balance sheet, and little to no wage growth. The US was doing pretty well 2012-2015 so the FED slowly raised rates. Now when I say slowly, I mean 0.25% every quarter or so with heavy broadcasting of what is going to happen so the market didn't freak out. The market and overall economy shrugged off these increases and life was good. Trump came in 2016 and poured gasoline on an already smoldering fire with the business tax cuts so we were running hot. LFG!

Then comes COVID in 2020. Holy shit balls we're all going to die. The market crashed. Everyone stays home. Economy comes to a halt...for like a couple months. FED opened up its book of mischief and started printing money heavily, dropping interest rates, and the party started up again. The stock market recovered insanely quickly and the housing market exploded. What the hell happened.

It turns out, the US consumer has an insatiable appetite for buying shit. And we were stuck at home bored out of our minds just buying anything from baseball cards to canoes. And if there's one thing to get an economy flowing, its buying. We bought so much shit we ran out of shit to buy. Now we have supply chain difficulties in part from manufacturers shutting down during COVID, increased safety protocols due to covid, workers having to stay home due to exposure, and high demand for goods. We also have a growing sentiment of workers not wanting to put up with bullshit for low wages and demanding higher pay. SUDDENLY WE HAVE WAGE GROWTH. This is huge. More wages. More money to buy shit. LFG!

Now all of this led to inflation. IT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNENT IS PRINTING MONEY. The high demand, increased wages, and shortened supply all led to inflation. This is why the FED infamously said inflation was ""temporary"" and they got raked over the coals about it. Of course what time duration the FED meant is not clear so they walked back those statements.

Remember the gas shortage FUD and gas price inflation? Give me a break. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy by the media so people went out and bought more gas than they needed which was more than the supply chain could handle and prices increased. Of course it came back down but we forget things quickly.

Now we have a highly contagious omicron variant with lower hospitalization rates. We basically are given a gift to vaccinate all these mouth breathers which may be the best outcome. Supply chains will catch up and inflation WILL GO DOWN. The moment the consumer price index (CPI) numbers come back less than the previous quarter buckle up buckaroo because here we fucking go. Higher wages, high demand, and an open economy due majority of population (hopefully) having antibodies. Bring on these 0.25% rate hikes. This will only help inflation come down and the FED does a really good job broadcasting what they will be doing so the market is well prepared.

Finally, there's so much damn money out there. With low interest rates, there's no where to put it but the stock market, real estate, private equity, and to some extent crypto. Early stage companies are getting funded with some slideware and a nice smile. This is also why crypto has boomed in 2021. Money is readily available and it's looking for somewhere to go.

For someone who is looking to actively trade, would it make sense to hold the investment amount in these no expense ratio mutual funds? Holding the investable amount as cash in the brokerage account seems like a bad idea since it loses value due to inflation. Instead, investing in a zero expense index mutual fund would allow it to grow in the market, but also provide one the opportunity to sell the required amount to fund stock buying opportunities at a target value.

A breakdown of the process -

1. Invest $25,000 in FZILX and leave it to market forces.
2. 3 months from them, Musk tweets something stupid and causes TSLA to drop 15% in 1 week.
3. Since you believe TSLA is now at a lower price than what it actually needs to be, you sell $2000 worth of FZILX and invest in TSLA instead.

I.e. the losers keep dragging the ETF down and there are more losers than winners. Kind of the opposite of the safety diversification via ETF usually offers. 

Solar power is going to be huge, but most of today's solar companies will go belly up before then and the amount of profit the survivors can make from manufacturing installing solar panels are dubious.

So instead of trying to pick a winner there, I'm inclined to invest in manufacturers of solar panel and system components that will profit from a booming solar market no matter which solar company will go boom or bust (same rationale as going with TMO instead of picking individual biotech companies, see also the selling shovels in a gold rush analogy.)

I found [this site listing component manufacturers](https://www.enfsolar.com/directory/component), but there's no way I can go through these thousands of listings and evaluate each company to find the best investment opportunity. Since someone else is bound to have already done this research, or might know of a few good examples of such companies, I thought I'd ask for advice here.

What preferably non-Chinese, profitable and established manufacturer of solar panel- or related components, or supplier of the necessary base materials would you invest in?

Ether, the token of the Ethereum network is a yielding asset. We can calculate an intrinsic value for the ETH token using traditional finance valuation models. 

You can find these in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_r4DVzqWgoP7k0y-YXVdyKfEtpTaY-F6f5s9lc7sBNE/edit?usp=sharing). This spreadsheet is read-only and won't be edited to meet the rules of /r/investing, is provided as is.

Hope you enjoy the analysis and motivates an interesting discussion.

**Introduction**

The cryptocurrency asset space is largely misunderstood by the market resulting in significant inefficiencies in its valuation. From wild speculative valuations in tokens with no specific purpose, to some very significant undervaluations in others. I think the best way to help the market find the fair value of each asset is by building valuation models that root the value of the token in its fundamentals. The expectation is that armed with better models, market inefficiencies will diminish with time.

**Intended Readership**

This post can be beneficial to those well-versed in traditional finance and fundamental valuation models that do not understand what cryptocurrencies are and see them as shiny magical tokens with no intrinsic value.

On the opposite end of the spectrum it can be beneficial to those well-versed in cryptocurrencies; what they are, their use and purpose and understand their utility. But are not necessarily familiar with financial valuation models.

The large decoupling between these groups of people is probably cause of the severe mispricings occurring in the space. Hopefully this post and the valuation models provided can help bridge the gap between the two.

**Understanding Ethereum**

Ethereum is a settlement layer capable of executing smart contracts (small programs), in this regard you could consider it as not too dissimilar in functionality to a payment processor (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Square...) that is also able to host and execute applications, like a Decentralized App Store. This settlement layer is highly decentralized and secure because it relies on thousands of independent nodes validating all the transactions executed on the network; there is no downtime, the network is censorship resistant, and is not owned by any individual or organization. This is the value proposition of the network, not every use case benefits from these properties but for those that do Ethereum is the leading platform.

**Ethereum Monetary Policy**

To pay for the security and decentralization the network pays its validators, remunerating them for their work. Additionally, this remuneration serves as an incentive for anyone to join the validation effort, increasing the security and decentralization of the network. This remuneration has 2 sources; newly minted tokens and transaction fees paid by the users of the network. I¬¥m going to provide analogies rooted in traditional finance to help illustrate the parallelisms.

- Newly minted tokens are not too dissimilar to the issuance of new stock. When a company emits new stock existing shareholders dilute themselves (they have a smaller share of the company) and the newly created shares are given as remuneration to a subset of them, for example to employees as part of a stock based compensation program. It¬¥s important to understand that creation of new tokens does not create value out of thin air, as it¬¥s self-diluting. Instead, there is a transfer of value from all token-holders to the validators that receive those newly minted tokens.

- Transaction fees paid by the users of the network can be compared in this analogy to the revenues. When a user wants to settle a transaction on the network it pays for its use. The more transactions and the more valuable the fees of those transactions the more revenue collected by the network. A traditional finance person should immediately understand that if there are cash flows entering the system you can use those to create a valuation model. The throughput of the network is an scarce resource so the price paid for transactions is subject to demand and supply dynamics.

The revenue of the network (i.e. the transactions fees) is used in one part (around 20%) to remunerate the validators and the rest (around 80%) to reduce the token supply. These percentages are not fixed by the protocol but are instead a result of demand for the available transaction throughput, the values here quoted are the currently observed proportion. The token supply reduction operates in a way not too dissimilar to a stock buyback program, where income of a company is used to reduce the circulating supply of shares. This token supply reduction is commonly  nicknamed ""burning"".

**Monetary Model**

The network generates revenues. These revenues are used to pay validators for their work and reduce token supply. At the same time the network issues new tokens, that are used as another source of remuneration for the validators. The interplay between the token supply reduction through burning and the token issuance determines if the token supply is deflationary (net token destruction), inflationary (net token creation) or flat (no net change). Thus Ethereum's monetary policy is defined programmatically but is also adaptative to the market, if the price of Ether falls too low for its given revenues it will enter a strong deflationary regime to self-correct the situation. This gives Ethereum a very strong monetary policy (arguably stronger than Bitcoin) and consolidates the token as a store of value as it can be used to calculate a long-term lower bound price of the token. You can see this in detail in the Monetary Model tab.

**Yield Model**

With the introduction of a burn mechanism Ether became a yielding asset, the burn mechanism results in an effective yield for all token-holders in much the same way a buyback results in shareholder yield for shareholders. Ether becoming a yielding asset will be cemented even further with the transition to Proof of Stake (a.k.a. ""the merge""). With it, token-holders can become validators of the network and receive also the fee revenue (the other 20% of the network revenues). 

Yield opens up an entirely new price discovery mechanism. Without yield, the price of a token is purely based in supply and demand (this is the current situation for most cryptocurrencies). We may know the supply ahead of time, as it's defined algorithmically, but demand is fickle and changes on a whim. This results in a lot of volatility, particularly with low market capitalizations and small circulating supplies.

But yield gives us a comparable across asset classes. All else being equal, money tends to flow to higher yielding assets to extract that yield, in doing so the price of the underlying asset increases reducing the yield. This causes assets to converge relatively quickly to a yield comparable to the rest of asset-classes given certain measure of risk (e.g., volatility, total loss of capital, etc...) and expected growth. If the price of Ether becomes too low for a given value of the network fees, it will result in a very large yield and investors will flock to it to obtain the yield. This allows us to build a yield based valuation model. You can find said model in the Yield Model tab.

**DCF Model**

Discounted Cash Flow models are the gold standard of valuation. In a Discounted Cash Flow model the intrinsic value of an asset is computed taking into account the future cash flows it will generate and to which the stakeholder is entitled.

The idea is very simple, if an asset generates cash flows the value of the asset should be that of all the future cash flows it will generate. At the same time, receiving a large lump-sum very far in the future should be worth less than receiving it today as there is a time value of money. Money today can be invested and receive with it certain rate of return, so we should discount the future cash flows to take into account the time value of money.

We can do this with Ethereum and calculate its intrinsic value. DCF models are particularly sensitive to our assumption of the expected future cash flows and the discount rate so they will be more accurate the better you can forecast them. You can find this model and some base assumptions in the DCF Model tab.

**Why 3 models?**

In truth, there should only be one model, the one that correctly predicts the intrinsic value of the network. And this model is, in fact, the DCF model. The problem is that correctly forecasting the future cash flows and having a proper estimation of the discount rate is very difficult which makes DCF models quite prone to the garbage in/garbage out phenomenon, where poor assumptions lead to poor predictions of the model. Because of this we can benefit from 2 models that are very simple in comparison:

- The Monetary Model gives us a very good long-term lower bound of the token value. As the network will execute its monetary policy in a way that leads to this price acting as a lower bound long-term. Since the price set by the Monetary Model must hold true in the long-term we can use this price as the terminal value of the DCF.
- The Yield Model gives us a very good short-term view of the token value. As this yield can be obtained today, giving the market a powerful mechanism to quickly reflect the price that results in a yield comparable to the rest of asset classes (given certain measure of risk). If you set the discount rate to your expected yield you can view the Yield Model as the first-order expansion of the DCF model.

So the two models are simplified version of the DCF for two different regimes: long-term (Monetary Model) and short-term (Yield Model)."|investing|Fundamental Valuation Models of Ethereum|127.0|0.67|['the Monetary Model', 'ETH', 'Visa', 'Ethereum']

With 2022 approaching ever so quickly, I was wondering what your approach to the upcoming year is in terms of asset allocation. 

I must admit that 2021 ended with quite a few developments that I would not have expected at all. In spite of supply chain issues, rising inflation, the continuous disruption of economic processes by COVID variants and an approaching end of the Fed‚Äôs more than generous support of the US market, most of the large indices are trading at or near their all time highs, with no signs of a short-term slowdown (granted the volatility has been up as of late mostly thanks to Omicron).

I honestly never would have expected markets to keep the course this easily with all the above mentioned uncertainties/headwinds coming at them. With that being said, what are your macro level expectations for 2022 and how does it affect your overall asset allocation?

I for starters am sitting on a relatively big pile of cash waiting to be deployed once markets cool down. My underlying assumption is that we are going to see some sort of major correction in the near to mid future and I‚Äôd like to profit from that.

With that being said my current allocation looks something like this:

-37,5% in real estate (as investment, not personal)
-23,5% in a 2,8% yielding life insurance 
-19,5% in stocks
-18,5% in cash but intended to be in stocks eventually
-1% in other financial assets

So what are you guys‚Äô thoughts going into 2022? Are you intending to modify your allocations once the fed raises the interest rates? And how are you currently allocating your assets?

Currently have 25k emergency savings and 25k in the market (mostly blue chips).

I assume they are similar to stocks where when you sell it takes several days to clear and funds transfer to your account. For that reason I would build the emergency fund up to 10k and sell stocks if an emergency came up in the first year before I could access the bonds. I don‚Äôt think I would keep more than whatever my emergency savings amount is in bonds because historically they earn less than VTO but am in favor because the ~3-7% return is much greater than a savings account.

""Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster warned investors to ""brace yourself"" for a potential correction in Big Tech during the first three months of 2022, as the market comes to terms with the likelihood that higher interest rates will force valuations to contract.""

However, Munster specifically highlighted high valuations for names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Munster quickly added that he believes in the long-term value of Big Tech but that earnings and revenue growth in 2022 will not be enough for most companies to overcome the contracting valuations that traditionally come with rising interest rates.

Tom Lee: 

""‚ÄúFor next year, I think it‚Äôs going to be treacherous.

&gt;China‚Äôs securities watchdog published a new draft regulation stating companies can list overseas as variable interest entities if they meet compliance rules

 

&gt;China‚Äôs securities watchdog has given tacit approval to a corporate structure that lets technology companies raise funds offshore, closing a two-decades-long regulatory loophole that has become a lightning rod in rising US-China tensions in capital markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chinese companies set up as variable interest entities (VIEs) are allowed to list in offshore markets if they register with regulators and meet compliance rules, according to a draft of a new regulation released on Christmas Eve by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The regulation also allows mainland-incorporated firms to directly list overseas without the need for a VIE if they meet the requirements. The draft was published online to solicit public opinion through January 23.  
&gt;  
&gt;The regulator said it would only assess the truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of submitted documents before giving applicants a green light for offshore listings, indicating that the registration-based system is not a stricter approval process.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The draft rule contradicts a [December 1 report from Bloomberg](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3158198/chinese-securities-regulator-discussions-over-vies-hong?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article) that said China planned to ban initial public offerings on foreign exchanges through VIEs to address concerns about data security. It added that fundraising through VIEs would still be allowed in Hong Kong. 

 

&gt;The CSRC said that the rule is not retroactive, so companies already listed as VIEs overseas are exempt from the stricter rules. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Under the new rule, Beijing will strengthen oversight of companies‚Äô operations, including the handling of data, before allowing them to list overseas."|investing|"""China‚Äôs new VIE rule eases concerns about overseas IPOs"""|65.0|0.83|['the China Securities Regulatory Commission', 'VIE', '&gt;China‚Äôs']

Our planning has mainly been centered around getting this after-tax money into Roth accounts so we can unlock the power of untaxed growth. This makes the most sense as my current marginal rate is the lowest it will be in my career, and we assume taxes will rise in the future. We already add $6k to my Roth IRA annually.

My new company offers a Roth 401k which at face value seems like an attractive way to more quickly convert more of these funds to tax-free growth.

Does this plan make sense?

* Open a Roth 401k with my new company
* Max it out with the new limit of $20,500 this year  

   * This will require me withholding about 40% of salary, which I have verified my new company allows.
* Each month, parent deposits the difference between the 40% contribution and the 5% I was already contributing to get the company match. This ensures my take-home pay remains consistent.
* When I leave the job in the future, I can convert the Roth 401k to a Roth IRA.  

   * Essentially allowing me to convert 6k + 20.5k = 26.5k a year of taxable funds to a tax-free Roth IRA account.

Mix those and you have 4 different scenarios (inflation and rising economy, inflation and declining economy, etc).  He wants to have 25% in each of these, so that he will have 25% of his money in what's best for the current environment, 50% in a one step away allocation, and only 25% of his money in something targeted at the polar opposite environment.

Bogleheads suggest you pick 3 funds and continually rebalance between them.  Something like S&amp;P500, Some bond ETF, and some international fund.  Doesn't have to be an even split, but you should stick with the same split over time and keep rebalancing back to it.

If we pretended that Dalio was naming 1 fund for each of the 4 categories and putting 25% into each of them and constantly rebalancing, then what these two different groups are doing isn't that dissimilar.

So I was thinking to myself what would such a 3 fund portfolio look like if one was trying to orient it toward either (1) bull market, (2) sideways market, or (3) bear market?  Could one name a reasonable fund/etf for each of those cases and then rebalance between them and not do too bad for themselves over different market conditions.

I should point out (because I know someone else will if I don't) that Hedgefundie has attempted to do such a 2 fund portfolio, just without the sideways piece, only doing Bull and Bear.  I think his strategy has some meaningful flaws in it, but I don't really want to focus on that here.  Still, it's a reasonable attempt at what I am talking about.

Perhaps a 3 fund portfolio for up/sideways/down could be something like (Up) UPRO, (Sideways) QYLD, and (Down) TLT?

Somebody think of something better for the down portion.  Needs to be some kind of Talebesque thing that has a a basket of high yielding stuff and buying OTM puts for pennies in large quantities.  I am sure such a fund probably exists and I just don't know what it is.

Theoretically, one could just regularly rebalance  such a portfolio and get some decent alpha out of it.

Theoretically, it should also be a portfolio that somebody could somewhat safely apply leverage to.

Broker probably won't allow anybody to buy UPRO on margin, but at least one could probably get +25% leverage while leaving all the UPRO as secured by the cash and dipping into margin for what is missing on the other two.  If one just doubled up on the QYLD piece and left the other two at 25% allocations that is probably fine too.

  Facts: 

   47M. Make \~$200K in a secure field in a medium COL area of the US. I also have a military 'retirement"" that is currently paying out at about $38K per year and grows 2-3% per year to match with inflation. I consider this part of my retirement as it equals about 1/1.5 mil in payout in my retirement years. Im single, with no kids. I rent at the moment and own my car outright. Im living on about 45% of my monthly income.

   I currently max out my 401K and my Roth is maxed out in January every year. However, I only have maybe 200K in my 401K as it sits. 

  OK here's the question now:

I relocated jobs last March and sold my house as part of it. In the new location, I decided to rent due to the housing market and uncertainty with the area. So, over that time I collected a bit of a nest egg for when I decided to buy the following year (now ish). Since then though, it looks like Im not going to buy at all which leads me to sitting on $100K cash that I feel should be working for me somewhere. Having this cash available gives me anxiety and I tend to obsess over it not going below a certain threshold. I believe I want to put it in the market so that I can relax (like I do with my 401k/Roth investments).

   What would you do with it, in the current market? Put it in a few ETFs? Spread it across some individual stocks? Just keep in cash? Buy property somewhere else? Just spend it on toys for me? I really want to get to the point where I can feel comfortable spending money for me now that Im at a good career point. I struggle with that now.

Side note: I have a separate funded emergency fund and have nothing else tax advantaged that I can use.

Would you sell newly acquired shares if the **TOTAL** capital gains tax paid is less than what you would pay if you sold older shares that would be taxed as long term capital gains?

Example: you have 10 shares acquired over a year ago for $5/share and 10 shares acquired last month for $10/share.  The current price of the stock is $11, so selling either lot will get you $110 before taxes.

Long term capital gains on the older shares is $6, while short term capital gains on the newer shares is $1.

# Equity Portfolio Idea From Options

Hello beasts

Has anyone tried to make a long only equity portfolio in the past based on put call ratios and if so, how did it perform? I think it may be a good strategy but have not tried it.

In my personal vision, I would first find the 50 most liquid options chains. Then, I would calculate the put call ratio every week, and rebalance to the 25 with the lowest ratio every week. What do people think would happen and has anyone ever tried anything similar?

&amp;#x200B;

I had the idea to borrow money from Interactive Brokers at 1.5% interest and invest in closed end funds like PDI which is yielding 10%.  I would pocket the difference.  After taxes I estimate I would clear between 5-7% free profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risks would be if PDI cut the dividend which I deem fairly unlikely or my prinicpal going down in value.  This I estimate would be the biggest risk as it could force me to sell my PDI at an inopportune time if I got a margin call.  I would have to manage the position.  Another risk would be IB raising the interest rates on using their margin which I deem fairly likely in a rising interest rate environment.  Are there any other risks I'm missing?

Rentokill announced to buy Terminix.

From the Document:

&amp;#x200B;

Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (‚ÄúADSs‚Äù), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash. Based on Rentokil Initial‚Äôs 5-day average daily volume weighted share price and the 5-day average of the SterlingUS Dollar exchange rate both over the period spanning 6 to 10 December 2021 inclusive, this values the entire share capital of Terminix at US$6.7billion, **implying a value of US$55.00 per share of Terminix common stock**, and represents an aggregate consideration mix of 80% stock and 20% cash and(**Emphasis added**)

Currently TMX is trading for \~$45 with the deal expected to close in 2nd half of 2022 at the above $55.That means in \~6 to 12 months the stock should appreciate by 22%. or annualized 44% to 22% respectively.

Does this mean the market is assuming the deal will not close or is the market missing something? It seems too obvious?

Disclosure: Long TMX

**Edit estimated Deal Value**:

**For the ADRs**It says 128,660,000 shares of RentoKill ADRs which closed $39.49 = $5.08 billion+ cash of $1.3 billion = 6.380 billion / 121.1489 million TMX shares = **$52.67** per share

From Document: Under the terms of the Agreement, Rentokil Initial will issue to Terminix shareholders at closing aggregate consideration comprised of approximately 643.29 million new Rentokil Initial shares (representing approximately 128.66 million American depository shares (‚ÄúADSs‚Äù), based on a 1:5 ADS to Rentokil Initial share ratio) and approximately US$1.3bn in cash.

**or for the English shares**

584.80 in pounds \* 0.0132 USD/GBX = $7.73 price in USD of english shares5.3094 english shares to TMX shareholder \* $7.73 = $41.05

\+11.00 in cash for TMX shareholders = **$52.05**

From Document:The cash election consideration and the stock election consideration will be equalized to the value of the aggregate consideration per Terminix share, as measured by the value of 5.3094 new Rentokil Initial shares and $11 in cash as of the second day prior to closing.

**Either way, Im getting about $52 for something selling at 45.08. I don't get why there is an approximate upside of 15% just sitting there.**

Of the dozen websites I have combed through I have not been able to find the answer to my question around realizing a loss on a larger quantity of shares than I purchased within the was sale window.  

I would like to do some tax loss harvesting prior to the end of the year but I want to make sure I fully understand this. I have a dividend paying stock that just reinvested the dividend to buy \~200 shares (say cost basis of $7) last week within the 30 day window I want to sell by EOY.  

I have a 1000 share lot at a cost basis of $9 and the stock is currently trading at $7.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to sell the 1000 share lot with a $9 cost basis for a loss.  Do I understand correctly that the wash sale would ONLY apply to 200 shares of those 1000 sold?  Or would it disallow the loss on the entire 1000 share lot?  

Here is the math:

($9 basis -$7 current share price) \* 1000 shares = $2000 unrealized loss today

Sell 1000 shares and realize losses on 800 shares \* $2 loss per share = $1600 realized loss allowed

200 shares \*$2 loss = Wash sale disallowed loss, add $2 cost basis to the 200 shares I recently purchased last week from the dividend.

They use a variety of mathematical models based on events to predict how news stories will impact stock movements in the short run.  In some cases, they have the ability to buy or sell stocks the second the news is released or have access to the information well before the public.

1. just 42.6% of common stocks have a buy-and-hold return (inclusive of reinvested dividends) that exceeds the return to holding one-month Treasury bills over the matched horizon.
2. More than half of common stocks deliver negative lifetime returns.

4. The 1,092 top- performing companies, slightly more than 4% of the total, account for all of the net wealth creation (returns in excess of one-month t-bills).

During an uptrend, the RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, and the indicator frequently hits 30 or under.

I have also invested in cyclical companies such as commodities and the retail sector. Reading books such as ""Benjamin Graham's Net Net Stock Guide"" by Evan Blaker, Joel Greenblatt, Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Peter Lynch's books, and the books by Philip Fisher have helped me to focus on the qualitative side of investing as well as different value investing approaches which has helped me look for good quality value stocks. 

Recently, I have used the wheels options strategy by taking further advantage of mispriced stocks such as getting paid to buy cheaper stocks via cash-secured puts and selling them for a profit when I think they are overvalued via covered calls.

Being empirical and wanting to find the best-tried investing methods, as well as behavioral finance has recently led me to momentum trading. Particularly, I have read ""Dual Momentum"" by Gary Antonacci and ""Quantitative Momentum"" by Wesley Gray. 

I was wondering if anyone else uses momentum trading and what are some key insights regarding the best momentum strategies. Are there any excellent resources that explain it in depth? 

Some questions I have are:

What are some of the best momentum indicators as well as strategies? What are the best methods of momentum trading? How long should you hold and optimize your holding position which tends to be less using momentum trading. Is trend following and using the 52 week high the best means? Would you do better by combining fundamental analysis with momentum trading or would it be better to separate the two approaches?

Based on what I have read so far it seems that some things you can do are compare different assets and see which ones are appreciating more (absolute momentum) and or then see which stocks/cryptos/bonds/commodities, etc are appreciating more in price (relative momentum). It also seems that a 3 -4 month holding period seems to be optimal and that it is better to buy or trade (reallocate) within the end of Feb, May, Aug, Nov for ""smart rebalancing.""

Firstly, I apologise if this is not the place to be posting this question. Feel free to point me to a better fitting sub if you can think of any

So, I've been working at a mature start up for about a year now. I joined as part of a growth cycle in which about 100 people were hired. My role is compensated well, mostly because I work in tech in a role with a lot of responsibility. I asked when I joined if I could have shares, they said it was in the works and coming to everyone soon. I didn't press too much as I was already receiving a big bump in salary.

Recently all existing employees have been offered Growth shares. The company have made a big deal about not wanting it to be about % stake in the business, or deciding based on salary. Which, if I'm being cynical, seems like that only stands to benefit them by making it harder to understand what you're getting.

Does anyone have experience receiving growth shares? Typically how many shares would you expect for a company at this stage? The only figure I've been told is based on the company's previous funding round, they were valued at ~$30m, if the company sold for $1B I would be looking at ~$90k return on the sold shares. Am I being unreasonable to think this isn't actually a very meaningful stake given how few startups actually reach that size?

Purely on numbers, I've worked the offer to be ~3.5% of my salary as Growth shares, vested over a 5 year period. Equating to ~0.0008% stakeholder in the business. 

Sorry for the ramble, Im planning to speak to them about it, but ideally I'd like a number in my head and some evidence of what other companies at this stage have offered in the past."|investing|I was recently offered shares by my employer|111.0|0.89|['Growth']

There is thought behind this. This will be in a non-tax account. With around 300 shares of TQQQ.

Others like Tesla, I expect to take a bigger jump up and make up more of the QQQ index in 2022.

I have around 300 shares of TQQQ. Enough for a simple covered call strategy on 3 lots. I plan on selling weekly covered calls on Monday morning. Will be looking for delta around 0.1-0.15.

This probably means the QQQ has run up a lot in a short period of time and I'm happy to wait for a dip back below by average selling price, to buy back the 300 shares.

If there is a prolonged crash in tech - still not so bad. I should still be able to get the weekly premiums consistently (though they may not be as high). I will continue gathering these premiums. They will not be put back into TQQQ. They will only go into TQQQ if/when I'm able to collect enough premiums to buy a full new lot. Otherwise, I'm happy to hang onto the premiums.

However, the markets rallied on the news of the taper from the FED.

From a valuations (economic benefits vs Risk) assessment, it makes sense that the markets would rally:

\- Interest rates remained the same.  
\- A day or two before the announcement the bond yield decreased therefore decreasing cost of debt.  
\- There was \*a little\* uncertainty surrounding MAYBE the Fed might touch interest rates a little bit. IF they HAD then cost of equity would have went up. But it was unlikely. Anyway the uncertainty surrounding this, made for an increased cost of equity in the days up until the meeting - so small sell offs/corrections occurred.  


BUT they never touched interest rates in the end!  
So Weighted average cost of capital would have decreased because the bond markets priced in the more aggressive tapers decreasing cost of debt and then cost of equity became less because the uncertainty around changing interest rates disappeared.

Any valuation method:  
\- PV of FCF - shows an increased MV  
\- Dividend discount models same thing.  
\- Multiples are going to get higher because decreased cost of capital.

Bear with me on the formatting, as I can't copy/paste tables that easily. This first part is an overview of Debt and Assets. TEVA purchased Actavis Generics off Allergan in 2015, which is the main origin of the debt. The generics business is volume-driven with not a lot of profit margin, so these purchases are not uncommon. It's a lot of cash, though, and one of the main pain points for the company right now.

The debt hinders growth/investment in biosimilars and resulted in rating downgrading \[Fitch BB, Moody‚Äôs Ba2 as of 31Dec20\]. It's the main focus of the current restructuring.

This table shows the relative high Cost of Sales relative to Net Revenue. I added some known expenses to get to the last column showing income after everything before. You can note the decrease in net revenue, which is mainly driven by generics price erosion from competition, consolidation of customers (85%) to achieve a greater bargaining power, and generics competition for a specialty blockbuster drug, Copaxone.

The last pain point is lawsuits, especially opioid and price-fixing. There is little data to be found on the merits of these lawsuits, but it's definitely spooking investors. What is clear are the costs of legal fees and goodwill impairments.

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Impairment (Intangible assets) (Billion USD)|Goodwill Impairment (Billion USD)|Legal expenses (Billion USD)|Operating Income (Billion USD)|Net Income (Billion USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020/       	2019/       	2018/       	2017/       	2016|1,5/           	1,6/           	2,0/           	3,2/           	0,6|4,6/                   -/	        	3,0/           	17,1/           	0,9|0,1/           	1,2/           	-1,2/           	0,5/           	0,9|\-4,4/           	-1,3/           	-2,6/           	-18,4/           	0,8|\-4,1/           	-1,0/           	-2,5/           	-16,5/           	0,3|

So it's not a pretty sight, and this all contributes to the low market capitalization.

The company has already begun restructuring, is aggressively reducing debt to the tune of 1-2 Billion USD a year, and is led by capable individuals. There are two specialty drugs (AJOVY and AUSTEDO) that are showing increased sales, although the pandemic is not helping in this regard.

Considering that the company is not paying dividends and has considerable risks, this is nothing for the risk averse or investors looking for quick bucks. However, the company valuation is down to the bare bones and there is good potential for long term investment. My decision to jump in is based on the restructuring underway, good leadership, and the risk constellation. The risk averse will like its long-term prospects but why away due to lawsuits exposure, the short-termists will see no point in investing now. I decided to park my gains from other stock here because I'm not risk averse and can afford to play the long game.

The lira touched 15.2 at 0606 GMT, a record low, and it has shed more than 50% of its value so far this year.  The central bank is expected to cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 14% at its policy-setting meeting later in the day, a Reuters poll showed despite inflation soaring above 21%.

It's not a 100% solely because it's not an option for my 401K.  This strategy has done me well, and I believe it remains a reasonable risk.  

Why Microsoft?  Are they a good ethical company?  Heck no!  They don't care about you or me.  They hold two monopolies and they're not shy about abusing them.  They hold monopoly on the consumer OS, and they have no qualms shoving it down your throat.  Don't want Windows 10?  Disabled Windows 10 update?  Too bad, you're getting Windows 10.  I've heard a few stories, such as someone teaching a class but couldn't because MS decided to install Windows 10 at that time.  Windows 11 coming soon to a pc near you.

They also have a near monopoly on office productivity apps, but I am seeing Google making some headway.

Microsoft is worldwide.  Not dependent on one economy.  The have customers in government, commercial and consumer.  They have hardware (e.g. surface pc, xbox, etc.), games, and software for all these market segments.  In my opinion they are as diverse as you can get.  Plus, no management fees to hold stock directly (versus ETF/Mutual funds).

Let's look at other top tech brands.

Apple:  Apple gets a premium for their brand.  While they leverage this for a very nice profit margin, this is a single point of failure.  They have to maintain that brand, and it's rare for a company to maintain this over decades.  They could handle 1-2 hits every couple of years (e.g. child labor), but it's still a single point of failure.

Facebook:  They need our privacy rights to be almost non-existent.  As soon as privacy starts getting enforced, a whole huge chunk of their revenue goes away.  They recently took a hit with Apple's privacy changes.  Not sure what would happen if another Cambridge Analytica incident occurs.

Tesla:  It's simply way overpriced stock.  I respect Elon for taking a huge risk with EVs when no one was taking this market seriously, but Tesla's quality is poor, it's super expensive to repair, and they screw over used buyers by making them pay for features that the original buyer already paid for.  I wish the company does well, but even if it does, there are manufacturers who know how to scale production, which I think Tesla still has yet to learn.  As soon as more EVs come online, I think Tesla will struggle to compete.

The above companies make up a significant portion of tech ETFs, which is why I don't want to buy them.

I bought into AMC because of two reasons:

1. I believe (and still do) that movie theaters will continue to recover in attendance over time as we normalize into whatever COVID is going to normalize into. The recent dip in the stock tells me it‚Äôs not baked into the price anymore at least. Still, I am optimistic about movie magic combined with the antsy-ness of a population stuck at home for further gains on attendance. Here‚Äôs a quick graph showing why I believe this so strongly: [https://www.the-numbers.com/market/](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/). Even if it never recovers to pre-pandemic levels, which I feel it will, there's still plenty of growth left.
2. I really loved the A-List program. Many people I know have started to adopt it, observed over the last several years. When I had free time, I‚Äôd go see multiple movies per month and felt it was a great deal. Now that I don‚Äôt, I still keep the sub around because I feel that I might. Classic subscription benefit for the company. Also being able to book for my friends without having to do the Venmo runaround is great, esp for sell out MCU premieres.
3. I see AMC as a medium term play. Is it a sustainable business over the long term and will movie going see long term growth over the next 5-10 years? Maybe, but I'm not willing to bet on that. I am willing to bet that there will be a stock bump from an attendance resurgence as we recover from COVID, so something more like a bet of 1-3 years.

On the other hand, I'm curious to know what the downside of LS is in those 33% of cases where DCA wins?

I'll give my expectations here first

I think that inflation will remain fairly high through 2022 but it won't be at the levels that it is now, maybe around 3-4%, which puts most bonds at negative real rates right now, forcing investors if they want a real return to go into the equity markets and/or chase high yield bonds.

When the federal reserve starts hiking interest rates I personally don't expect that they will raise them at a very fast pace however if inflation doesn't start taming down they might. When rates rise the risk-free rate rises and its effect on equities is usually bad. As the discount rate rising the price that investors are willing to purchase a security will decrease or at least for institutional investors won't which of course make up most of the market. I think that may not be the case next year however because if investors still need to go into the equity market to chase real returns, the equities should still rise. I'm worried that equities are already in a slight bubble and that another year of these returns could show a market correction back down. If I was a betting man I would assume that within the next 1-3 years there will be a negative return in the S&amp;P500 which has only happened once in the last 12 years.

Investors still can't enter into the bond market without giving up a return. Sure an investor can buy futures contracts on treasuries because they expect an upward shift in the yield curve, which I expect to happen, to get a higher yield and decrease their interest rate risk. However, if you cannot accurately predict when the fed is done raising rates then that won't help you as when you are obligated to buy those treasuries you will have interest rate risk issues. Buying short-term bonds to help with duration would help that problem but those also will more than likely result in a negative real return anyways if inflation doesn't cool off and the equity should've been the move anyways.

I would say that the Financial Services sector will benefit from the rising yields especially as corps and people demand large purchases as demand is hot.

I would also say that Industrials and Cyclicals will outperform as demand will drive the Cyclicals and the Industrials from infrastructure and servicing the demand in Cyclicals.

I think that elevated Materials prices will fall, hurting that sector.

Staples could be a hedge against a downturn in the market which I expect in the coming years.

Technology and communication services may have a bumpy road ahead with rising rates because the discount rate increasing hurts them the worst. Comm services wouldn't be as greatly affected but because of high tech companies in the space. More value may be the direction to take.

I'm always bullish on healthcare as innovations and rising populations will always benefit that sector. I may change my focus away from Biotech and into more stable earning healthcare companies.

Personally, I think Value over Growth or at least blend.

Summary: 

A wave of programs intended to boost loans from European banks has has left Euro banks flush with cash and little opportunity for investment. The situation has driven the same banking institutions to look over seas for places to park cash.

The process has caused a significant demand for USD as European banks move Euros to Dollars  to earn 0.05% in deposits with the Fed. even with a strengthening dollar and paying a premium for euro cross-currency basis swaps, the opportunity continues to look attractive to European banks whom were able to borrow from the ECB at -1.0%.

Analysts expect this trend to diminish after the first of the year once banks year end balance sheets are set and in anticipation of additional treasury supply following the Feds tapering &amp; increased debt ceiling.

The relative recent strength of the USD and the potential for slowdowns in Dollar demand from Europe could provide an opportunity to rebalance existing US Equity/Int'l Equity positions that have become out of sync due to dollar strength and the relative equity performance over the past year."|investing|Cash Glut in Eurozone Drives Dollar Demand|358.0|0.91|"[""US Equity/Int'l Equity"", 'Euro', 'ECB', 'Fed', 'USD']"

My property taxes and insurance totals $535 a month for my escrow to have a tiny surplus at the end of the year. My home owners insurance just informed me they're increasing the premium by about $150 a year. 

**El Plan**: I'm going to purchase $550 in QQQ on the first of every month ($550*12=$6600) from 2/1/2022 to 1/30/2023 (property taxes due in TX.)

I looked at a ETF QQQ calculator. Every year, for the past 10 years, it would win, with varying profits of $200 for a particular year to $1700 for a particular year. Two years, it lost. Biggest loss $500 for that year. 

I also did the math and found it would be slightly more profitable (1-2%) if I made my purchases weekly of $127($127*52=$6600 of QQQ.)

**Where I could be wrong**: I am starting to think about the taxes side of it. Will I get smoked because this money will only be in an account 11 months at a time before starting again after the taxes and insurance is paid? I don't think the IRS is going to eat away at my plan when it's all done each year. ($-500 to $1700)

Also, i am likely going to just grow the account in anticipation for rising property taxes and home values (Insurance seems to go up when value of home rises - go figure.)

**Am I crazy?** I searched and couldn't find much info about doing this. I've seen people do ""high-yield"" accounts, but nothing about purchasing stocks weekly/monthly instead. Bet your ass that the banks and lenders are using the money we put in for escrow to invest anyway.

I came across this thread on Reddit about Roblox and various practices they employ, whilst there was a lot of concerning things, I have some questions about the in game items and marketplace offered by Roblox.

One of the comments I saw was about Roblox's valuation on the stock market and that got me thinking about what I consider a securities market within Roblox itself.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this and whether or not you'd think these items to be considered securities. I may have gotten certain things horribly wrong with regards to US law, assumptions made etc, so feel free to call me an idiot if so, but please point out your counterarguments! My post mainly focuses on Roblox, but realistically it could be applied to any game that allows in game items to be resold.

https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/rfgazz/roblox_pressured_us_to_delete_our_video_so_we_dug/

*****

I know they're only in game items, but I think they could be classified as securities because they can be bought and sold (indirectly) with real money (via robux).

Now of course I am not a lawyer, and have no clue how any of this works (and how it probably also doesn't apply to many other companies that sell, resellable in-game items)

##The Howey Test

&gt; The Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an ""investment contract,"" and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the Howey Test, an investment contract exists if there is an ""investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.""

- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp

###Investment of money

&gt; ‚ÄúThe first component of the Howey test focuses on the investment of money. The determining factor is whether an investor chose to give up a specific consideration in return for a separable financial interest with the characteristics of a security""

- *Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. SG Ltd.*, 265 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2001)

When Roblox releases an item for sale, I believe that it could constitute an investment of money, as the purchaser gives up their Robux (specific consideration) in return for an in-game item (separable financial interest with the characteristics of a security). In this case, I would argue that a contract is formed by two interested parties: Robux and the purchaser of the asset with regards to ownership of the asset.

**But wait, it's Robux, not money?**

&gt; ""it is well established that cash is not the only form of contribution or investment that will create an investment contract. Instead, the ""investment"" may take the form of ""goods and services,"" Daniel, 439 U.S. at 560 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 797 n. 12, or some other ""exchange of value.""""

- *Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight*, 940 F.2d 564 (10th Cir. 1991)

Basically here I am arguing it doesn't have to be cash that is being used to form the contract, and yes, Robux does fulfill this requirement. (And bear in mind Robux can be bought and sold for USD and various other currencies).

###Common enterprise

&gt; A common enterprise is a venture ""in which the `fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment. . . .'"" It is not necessary that the funds of investors are pooled; what must be shown is that the fortunes of the investors are linked with those of the promoters, thereby establishing the requisite element of vertical commonality. Thus, a common enterprise exists if a direct correlation has been established between success or failure of [the promoter's] efforts and success or failure of the investment.

- *Securities &amp; Exchange Commission v. Eurobond Exchange, Ltd.*, 13 F.3d 1334 (9th Cir. 1994)

I would argue that a common enterprise is established by the fact that the value of the asset purchased by the investor is dependent on Roblox's efforts in advertising a known asset on its marketplace, managing the marketing and scarcity of the asset, as well as it's initial offering price etc.

Furthermore, after Roblox issue the assets, they still oversee the exchange of these assets. If the investor is successful and decides to sell at a higher cost (whether to Roblox or an unaffiliated party), there is a direct correlation between the investor's success and Roblox's success as Roblox take a 30% cut of the sale. If the value was lower, Roblox would still take a 30% cut but won't be as successful if the sale was higher (in some cases significantly higher than the original price).

### Expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others

An investor may purchase an in-game asset from Roblox under the impression that it is a limited offering and may presume that the value of the known asset will increase such that Roblox limits the sale of these assets to a fixed amount. Moreover, the investor assumes risk directly coming from the promoter, for example in the event that Roblox issues more of the same assets; this would increase the supply of the asset and potentially reduce its perceived value.

###Are Roblox in-game items securities then?

I don't know, like I said, I'm not a lawyer. I know other games also have similar models but I've never heard them be critiqued as securities. Loot boxes have had some contention about being gambling, but I think it might be time to start looking at virtual assets as securities. Though a lot of games do not let you resell the items (e.g. Fortnite), or if they do then it's only for an in game currency that cannot be converted back to a fiat currency (e.g. EA FIFA).

Roblox allow users to:

- buy Robux for fiat currency (e.g. 100,000 Robux for 1250 USD)
- invest in assets with that Robux,
- sell assets for Robux (whilst Roblox takes a 30% cut) at a profit or loss (but Roblox's fortunes from the sale are directly correlated with the investors fortunes from the sale),
- sell that Robux for fiat currency (100,000 Robux for 350 USD - a 72% exchange fee!)

In my totally not legal opinion, Roblox is effectively running an unregulated currency exchange when it comes to the selling of Robux (via Tipalti), an unregulated securities market when it comes to the buying and selling of in-game assets (which may be issued/sold by Roblox, but they benefit regardless due to a 30% commission - and they benefit more if they can create demand and scarcity for items they issue), and have created scenarios where there users are unwittingly becoming investors of securities aided by price history charts, information about limited availability, generating and marketing hype around assets etc.

In my opinion these assets are more similar to securities than they are to commodities.

Anyway, I was looking to start a discussion regarding this, I could be very wrong and I accept that; especially as this model has been used for a long time I believe (especially amongst MMO games?). I would love to hear any counterarguments etc, or other related talking points

*****

Flaw 1: You never own the asset itself, the assets always belong to the developer studios / companies themselves and are licensed to Roblox to be able to be used on the platform, though no ownership changes hands

Thanks to /u/McPutio for pointing this out

Flaw 2: You cannot sell Robux for real USD made in this way (though there probably are workarounds that Roblox do not approve of)

Thanks to /u/hiImKhi for pointing this out! It's a part of their DevEx platforms rules that the Robux must be ""earned"".

This means their clause in the ToS about Robux not being redeemable for cash makes a lot more sense now, as developers can't cash out any Robux other than that made by selling items that they have created"|investing|"[Discussion] Are in-game virtual items that can be sold for ""real money"" considered securities under US Law?

I manage most of my assets personally and, as a result, I feel an ongoing responsibility to understand the world around me, as this enables me to make the best investment decisions I can.

Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking about how to best allocate my portfolio given the current state of asset valuations, government debt, and general investor sentiment.

Through studying the works of Ken Galbraith, Howard Marks, Ray Dalio and other great investors, I have learned that the single most important variable in determining whether I should be aggressive or defensive with my portfolio strategy is the debt cycle. The ability to understand where we are in the debt cycle, and adjust our portfolios accordingly, is one of the hallmarks of great investors.

I have decided to share my thoughts here in order to get your feedback.

Before diving in, I want to emphasize that these are my views, and that different people have different perspectives. I hope that by sharing my views, I will encourage debate and advance our understanding together.

***TLDR:*** *The debt &amp; credit cycle are paramount in helping me understand how to think about my portfolio strategy.*

# Cycles

At its core investing is making good decisions about the future. To do this well, investors need to form probability distributions of different outcomes to guide their actions.

But it is important to remember that even if we know the probabilities, we don‚Äôt necessarily know the outcome.

Howard Marks has a helpful analogy: successful investing is like choosing a lottery winner. The winner is determined by one ticket (outcome) being pulled from a bowl of tickets (many possible outcomes).

Superior investors have a better sense of what tickets are in the bowl, and thus, whether it is worth participating in the lottery. Said another way, great investors don‚Äôt know exactly what the future holds, but they have an above-average understanding of future tendencies and probabilities.

This brings us to cycles.

Understanding cycles helps us form a view of future probabilities. It helps us understand how many winning lottery tickets there are in the bowl.

Analyzing cycles is not a precise science. The goal is not to time the market; rather, it provides a directional sense of what has happened, and what might happen. Marks explains this elegantly:

*The superior investor is attentive to cycles. He takes note of whether past patterns seem to be repeating, gains a sense for where we stand in the various cycles that matter, and knows those things have implications for his actions. This allows him to make helpful judgments about cycles and where we stand in them. Specifically: Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages? If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that we‚Äôre now in dangerous territory? Is the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap) because of what‚Äôs been going on cyclically?*

The most important cycle for investors to follow is the debt cycle.

# Credit &amp; Debt

Since we will use the terms ‚Äúcredit‚Äù and ‚Äúdebt‚Äù a lot, I will quickly define them.

Credit is the giving of buying power. When you take on credit, you exchange it for a promise to give it back; this is called debt.

Credit and debt, in and of themselves, are good things, and little credit and debt can be a bad thing. For example, if there is credit available to build roads, schools, and other essential infrastructure, that is a good thing. If the credit and debt are used to consume goods outside of one‚Äôs income level, that is a bad thing.

So, the overarching principle is that credit is desirable when the borrowed money is used productively to generate enough income to repay future debt obligations. If this occurs, good decisions have been made, and both the lender and borrower will benefit.

# Debt Cycles

At the highest level, a debt cycle is the oscillation between credit and debt being easily available and being scarce. \[1\]

When credit is easily available, there is more money in the system. This leads to growth in GDP, asset prices, incomes, etc. and is called an economic expansion, or a ‚Äúboom.‚Äù To prevent prices from growing indefinitely, central banks taper credit, which causes everything to shrink. This is called an economic contraction, or a ‚Äúbust.‚Äù This dynamic has existed for as long as credit has been around, predating the Roman Empire. \[2\]

Debt cycles are nothing more than a logically driven series of events that recur in patterns. Whenever you borrow money, a debt cycle is created.

Let‚Äôs explore this in more detail.

A debt cycle has two distinct phases: (1) expansion; and (2) deflation.

**Expansion:**

Every debt cycle begins with widely available credit.

There is a famous line in In Fields of Dreams, ‚ÄúIf you build it, they will come‚Äù. In the economy, if you offer cheap debt, people will borrow.

When debt is cheap, the threshold for its productive use is lower and skews more toward consumption. Since one person‚Äôs spending is another person‚Äôs income, higher consumption leads to higher incomes. Eventually, this leads to higher asset prices (stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto-assets, etc.) since there is more money chasing assets.

This has a positive self-reinforcing effect.

As incomes and asset prices inflate, people feel rich and start to take on even more debt.

Creditors look at the increased net worth of their debtors and feel comfortable giving them more debt. \[3\] This strengthens the feedback loop. Risk averseness diminishes, investor sentiment shifts toward optimism, and everyone thinks the good times will last forever. At this point debt is used more recklessly to fund consumption or projects with negative returns.

**Deflation:**

Eventually, to stop the upward cycle central banks taper credit, by making it more expensive. Making debt more expensive has two impacts: (1) people are less likely to take on new debt; and (2) existing debt becomes more expensive, which increases the risk of default and shifts spending away from consumption and investment to debt repayment. This triggers a negative spiral.

A lack of credit creates a liquidity problem. Investors and lenders become more critical of who they lend to. There is less money flowing around and consumption is reduced. Reduced consumption reduces income (remember that one person‚Äôs spending is another‚Äôs income). Lower incomes and lower asset prices mean lower net worths. Lenders, who were providing credit based on higher income and asset prices feel exposed and tighten credit even more. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle and the downward spiral continues.

**Resetting the cycle:**

To combat the downward spiral, central banks lower interest rates and make credit easily available again.

This marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next.

# The Most Important Cycle

The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains available than any other single factor ‚Äì Howard Marks

Why do I ascribe such importance to debt cycles?

Because credit, at least, impacts four important economic factors:

* Income Growth: Open credit markets are inflationary for wages. When credit is available, consumer spending is high. One person‚Äôs spending is another‚Äôs income, thus resulting in higher incomes and tighter labor markets.
* Net Worth / Asset Growth: Easily available credit results in more money chasing the same assets. This leads to higher asset prices and, as a result, higher net worths. Investors feel rich.
* Earnings / Company Growth: Companies need to fund investment in innovation and R&amp;D to grow. Credit makes up the largest part of the capital pool. Cheap credit allows numerous projects to be funded, resulting in higher growth.
* Default Rates: Credit must be available for maturing debt to be refinanced. Entities, like companies, governments and consumers, often don‚Äôt pay off debts. Most of the time they roll them over. But if a company is unable to secure more debt at the time that its existing debt comes due, it may      default and enter bankruptcy. \[4\]

When the credit markets are wide open, the cumulative effect of the above is overly optimistic investor sentiment. When incomes and net worths are high, growth rates attractive, and all businesses avoiding default, people think the music will never stop. As a result, the potential risk-reward spectrum of investing is at its least favorable.

But investor sentiment is also a cycle, shifting from overly euphoric to overly pessimistic. When we enter the deflationary stage of debt cycles, the inverse is true.

# Making Good Decisions

The ultimate purpose of this essay is to enable you, the reader, to have a sense of where we stand in the debt cycle and take the appropriate action.

As such, I have outlined some typical signs of an open and cautious credit market.

Signs of an open credit market:

* Fear of missing out on profitable opportunities
* Reduced risk aversion, due diligence and skepticism
* Too much money chasing too few deals
* High debt levels and reduced ability to service debt expense
* High asset prices, low potential returns, high actual risk, and low perceived risk

Signs of a cautious credit market:

* Fear of losing money
* Heightened risk aversion and skepticism
* Shortage of capital everywhere
* Economic contractions and difficulty refinancing debt
* Low asset prices, high potential returns, low actual risk and excessive risk premiums

What does all this mean?

It means that one of the best ways to enjoy superior returns is to get the market on your side. Outcomes will never be under your control, but if you invest when the lottery tickets are biased toward favorable, you will have the wind at your back. Understanding cycles gives you a better chance of knowing when this is and positioning your portfolio accordingly. It helps you understand how many winning tickets are in the bowl and whether you should buy one.

The next logical question is where are we currently in the debt cycle and how should my portfolio be skewed toward the balance between aggressive and defensive?

At the time of writing this, I am leaning toward neutral-to-defensive. \[5\] When uncertainty is high, asset prices should be low, creating high potential returns that are compensatory. However, the combination of money printing and low interest rates has forced asset prices to be the opposite. While I don‚Äôt think prices are egregiously high, it is hard to find mouthwatering deals.

*Notes, Inspirations &amp; Additional Readings*

\[1\] Ray Dalio explains that there are two debt cycles we should pay attention to: the short-term debt cycle and the long-term debt cycle. For the sake of this essay, I have ignored this distinction and the policy and political implications associated with them.

\[2\] In Debt: The first 5000 years David Graeber lays out the historical development of debt. The first recorded debt system was in the Sumer civilization around 3500 BC.

\[3\] What I find fascinating is that this seems rational. For example, if you buy a house for $50 in year 1 with $25 of debt your total debt-to-asset ratio would be 50%. The next year, your house is worth $75 on paper, so your debt-to-asset ratio is now 33%. Based on this, you take on more debt to get the ratio back to 50%, resulting in \~$38 of debt. But what if your home price drops back to $50? Then your debt-to-asset would be 76%.

The point here is that the amount of credit one has available is often based on asset value, which is a variable number.

\[4\] Many corporate assets, such as buildings and machinery, are long-term in nature. But they are often financed with short-term debt because the cost of borrowing is lower relative to long-term debt. This mismatch is what drives the default risk that is associated with credit markets drying up.

\[5\] It is outside the scope of this article for me to go into great details as to why.

EvBox: Europe‚Äôs biggest EV charging-station company.

-190,000 EV charging ports delivered globally around the world up to the year 2020, the most of any company in Europe, with that number expected to be much higher now in 2021.

-$135 million in revenue for 2021.

-Their charging stations look [fabulous](https://i.imgur.com/6ungMKG.png)

-[Attractive valuation](https://i.imgur.com/l4cVmiK.png), much cheaper than its competitors, EvBox will be trading at only 6.7x 2021 EV/Revenue, and 3.6x their 2022 revenue. Compare this to Chargepoint that trades at 76.1x their 2021 revenue, and 43.6x their 2022 revenue. 

-A 72% YoY Growth from 2020 to 2021, from $79 million to $135 million in revenue. They have also announced in a statement that they expect revenue for next year to be $252 million, which is a 87% growth from this year. 

-EvBox quality of products [compared to its peers](https://i.imgur.com/6dw2z7K.png)

-EvBox partners with key companies from various industries around the world to provide charging infrastructure for cities, enterprises, and residents.

-Partners include: France‚Äôs ""Engie""($70 billion dollar company), France‚Äôs ""Rexel""($13 billion dollar company), Sweden‚Äôs ""Vattenfall""($18 billion dollar company), Netherlands ‚ÄôEneco‚Äô($4,6 billion dollar company), Denmark‚Äôs ‚ÄôNorlys‚Äô(4,8 billion dollar company), Iceland‚Äôs ‚ÄôOn Power*, and many others companies around the world from different nations.

-Example of [customers](https://i.imgur.com/4cxHNxX.png) include: Ikea, Lidl, DHL, Pfizer, Mcdonalds etc. 

-Through partnerships, EvBox has managed to provide cities around the world with charging infrastructure, cities such as Amstardam, Rotterdam, Monaco, New York State and many others.

-[European Market Leader](https://i.imgur.com/0YuCHr5.png): There exists two types of charging methods for electric vehicles, they're called ""AC"" and ""DC"". EvBox has a 25% market share of all ""AC"" public charging in Europe, and a 35% market share of all ""DC"" charging in Europe, which is just incredible.  

-Award winning tech, awards include: 1st place in the CleanTech sector for Netherland's ""Deloitte Technology Fast 50"" in 2016. Named a Grid Edge Award winner by Greentech Media and highlighted as an industry leader focused on paving the way towards tomorrow's distributed energy systems in 2017. Named a CES Innovations Award Honoree in the category of Smart Energy with the Elvi product in 2018. Also featured on the Inc. 5000 Europe List of fastest-growing private companies in 2018. Named as a leading provider of Public Charging Network and EV Charging Services by Navigant Research in 2019. Won a CES Innovations Award, a iF Design Award, and a Red Dot Award. 

-EVBox is set to install [300,000 charging stations](https://www.electrive.com/2021/09/16/evbox-to-install-300000-charging-stations-across-denmark/) across Denmark by the year 2030. The contract is with Denmark‚Äôs largest energy and telecommunications company [Norlys](https://news.evbox.com/en-WW/201875-norlys-signs-multi-year-partnership-with-evbox-group-to-boost-electric-mobility-across-denmark), a company which had $4,8 billion in revenue for 2020. Installations have already started.

State of the spac: Negotiations have been ongoing for almost a year now and are still ongoing today, and I believe that a confirmation on whether the merger will happen or not should be due any minute now. If the negotiations fail, TPGY‚Äôs stock price would probably go back down to nav at $10 which is only a -2% loss considering the share price is $10,18 at the moment of writing this. However if the negotiations succeed and we get a merger, we could perhaps get a +200% or even +300% gain considering that previously a merger news-article made the share price go from $10 to $33 in only a couple of days earlier this year.

**TLDR;** $TPGY is negotiating for a merger with EvBox, Europe‚Äôs biggest EV charging infrastructure company, with $135 million dollars in revenue for 2021, over 190,000 charging stations in 2020, partnerships with many different multi billion dollar companies around the world from different nations including France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland etc. 300,000 charging stations set to be installed in Denmark by the year 2030, award winning technology, cheaper valuation compared to its peers, proven better quality of products compared to its peers, long list of famous brands as their customers, etc. You can lose -2% if negotiations fail and it goes back to NAV, however if the deal does go through it could explode, maybe to the levels of its previous shareprice of $33 which is a 330% gain. This is a great deal which is the reason I've chosen to invest.

I am fully aware and agree that cloudflare's current valuation is insane according to current revenue figures. However, I think Cloudflare has disruptive potential and can increase their growth rate in the future.

Cloudflare R2 is their zero egress(data withdrawel)-fee  cloud storage product. Cloudflare's entire product portfolio is rapidly expanding and is incredibly developer-friendly

[Cloudflare R2 revenue potential](https://www.vantage.sh/blog/the-opportunity-for-cloudflare-r2)

This is an analysis that is fundamentally correct, albeit overly positive. However, assuming R2 can disrupt at least 500m in revenue each year in Cloudflare's favor and the rest of their business keeps growing at 50%, this would immediately massively reduce Cloudflare's insane valuation to a reasonable level.

But, there's more - 

Cloudflare's moat is their versitile edge computing platform with cybersecurity applications. R2 essentially gets added utility due to this. Cloudflare is super developer friendly and an industry standard and has it's hands on massive parts of the internet. 

$NET vs. $SNOW - I think Snowflake will saturate it's market soon enough but Cloudflare is just beginning to expand into its footprint.

Cloudflare's serverless compute environment has some really cool cybersecurity applications as well

[Cloudflare Zaraz Cybersecurity](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-cloudflare-bought-zaraz/)

Zaraz uses Cloudflare's super fast edge network to isolate vunerable web plugins, allowing them to function identically as if they are natively installed but without the risk of providing security risks and accessing data it shouldn't touch. This is massive if you understand web development and how sketchy some shitty plugins can be.

Keep in mind their core business has 79% gross margins, above 100% revenue retention (squeezing more money from existing customers), is developer friendly in a super important part of the cloud computing future, massive cybersecurity footprint, and is rapidly growing their large customer base.

I'm aware Cloudflare is risky and overvalued, and a speculative bet on edge computing and disruption. However, their team is so talented and their products are so fantastic that I don't care. I think their revenue growth has a very solid shot to speed up in the future and they are only beginning to grow into their shoes.

1. I found an apartment in Hannover which is, according to Immoscout24, pretty cheaply priced. It categorizes the prices as retty low in the price range it deems for an apartment of this type within this locality. Should one trust the valuation of immoscout24? 
2. The apartment building was built in 1930s, but it was totally renovated in 2006. From the pictures, it looks quite good. It's Energy Efficiency class is also A. Is it still okay to buy an apartment from a building that was built that long ago? 
3. The apartment is on the highest floor, or Dachgescho√ü in German. Although only a small portion of the apartment has the slopes due to it being on the highest floor, is it a good idea to buy an apartment on the highest floor?
4. The apartment has a ""Hausgeld"" of ‚Ç¨300 per month. At first I felt it was really high, however, google says in Germany normal Hausgeld is between 2.5-4.5 times per sq meter. Considering the apartment is 110 sq meter, I think it's okay. What do you think, is ‚Ç¨300 really okay? Is there any way to reduce Hausgeld? 
5. I will visit the apartment next week, so obviously I will have a more detailed look and get better perception than what I can have from the pictures. What are the key things I should really focus on?
6. The last question, is it at all a good time to buy an apartment at this moment in time in Germany?

&gt; The reporting on the 3.8% for shelter may raise eyebrows, but independent of disputing the data the raw math on this is shocking.

The US is not alone in dealing with inflation, for example Canada reported 3 weeks ago an [annual inflation rate of 4.7%, the highest in 18 years](https://www.westerlynews.ca/news/canadas-consumer-price-index-makes-largest-year-over-year-leap-in-18-years/)."|investing|Inflation surged 6.8%, even more than expected, in November to fastest rate since 1982|2380.0|0.97|['rd8rjn']

But most people just get offered a pension set up for them by their employer, and that pension puts their money in a lifestyle / target data type fund.

These target date / lifestyle type funds tend to be 20-50% UK equities, while the UK accounts for about 2% of global GDP, so it would seem to be overweight.

With the CBRT reducing interest rates, the public banks have followed suit with reducing housing loan rates to ridiculously low levels around 0.70% yearly but private banks haven't. Something similar had happened last year also with rates lower than 0.70% with government subsidies in housing purchases.

Last week data came in that said loan defaults increased 150%. Especially public banks are scrambling to give loans to everyone. They literally call people earning minimum wage and try to give them housing loans more than 10x their yearly income.

The result of all this is that houses have sold like hot cakes since 2020. House prices have nearly doubled in one year. But no one is living in these houses. In 2018-2019 we had tens of thousands of empty houses that could not be sold. Now we apparently have a housing shortage.

1639102739.0|0.0|t3_rcxn4x|594.0|"A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

1639051757.0|0.0|t3_rcgd43|323.0|"One of the most overlooked stocks on the American stock market is Dropbox. I personally love it. It's got a lot of potential and the recent drop in price opens up an excellent opportunity for new investors.

# Dropbox at a glance

So, why should we care about Dropbox? Simple. It's a well-performing business that keeps beating analyst expectations. In fact, Dropbox does not have a single earnings or revenue expectations miss since they floated on the stock market! Yes, Dropbox's growth may be slowing down a tiny, tiny bit, but it is still double digits. This growth is likely led by the overwhelming switch since last year to working from home. A lot of people are also starting their own small businesses and they need solutions like Dropbox to help them organise their files, documents and so on. So, the question is, what does Dropbox actually do? Their flagship product, Dropbox, is a cloud storage solution similar to Google Drive, One Drive, iCloud and so on. Essentially, you can store files on Dropbox and synchronise and share them across PC, mobile, tablets and so on. However, Dropbox is actively striving to become a workspace platform or a smart workplace. Over the last three years they have also acquired HelloSign and DocSend that provide even more capabilities to its users. HelloSign provides the ability to send, receive and manage legally binding electronic signatures, whereas DocSend allows you to securely share documents with other people or businesses, track their usage, provide NDAs, meaning Non-Disclosure Agreements, eSignatures, watermarking and so on. Overall, these three services provide the backbone of the Dropbox product offering. However, Dropbox continues to look for new ways to improve and expand and have recently introduced three new features: Capture, Replay and Shop. I am really interested in the Shop feature, I think that has a lot of potential, but it's still too early to tell. If it goes well though, it could become a very successful marketplace for digital content.

# Earnings, revenue and key metrics

This all sounds really good, but let's look at the numbers. Always look at the numbers before you invest ***especially*** these days when there are so many companies that talk a lot, but have nothing to show for it. Like a lot of modern tech companies, the Dropbox business model revolves around subscriptions and that means it is relatively predictable. As long as users are satisfied with the product, they will continue using and paying for it. In Q3 of 2021, Dropbox had over 700 million registered users with 16.49 million paying users up from 15.25 million last year and those include both individuals and business subscriptions. Dropbox's business model focuses on converting existing users into paying users and we can see it's obviously working from this increase of 8.1% in the number of paying users per year. What Dropbox also does is upsell to existing users and nudge them to upgrade to premium plans, purchase additional licences and so on. As they say though, the proof is in the pudding. Over the last year, Dropbox has managed to increase the average revenue per user to $133.79 compared to $128.03 last year, which is a steady increase of 4.5%. When combined with the increase in paying users, that results in an increasingly profitable business and, as a result, Dropbox shows consistent growth every single quarter. Dropbox had 9 consecutive quarters of rising earnings, but broke their streak in the latest one. Q3 of 2021 showed a tiiiny dip from $0.40 to $0.37 dollars EPS, but that is still up 42% since last year. On the flipside, their revenue has grown every single consecutive quarter since they floated on the market with an average revenue growth of 12.5% to 19% year-on-year. Dropbox's revenue for Q3 was $550.2 million compared to $487 million last year so an increase of 12.9%. We can also see a decent increase in Dropbox's free cash flow of 18.4% to $221.5 million in Q3 of 2021.

# Expectations

Going forward, analysts expect that Dropbox will see a 9.8% increase in revenue next year and a 6% increase in earnings. This doesn't sound like much, but it follows after one of Dropbox's best years so far. Plus, analysts keep pushing their expectations up, which, again, means that Dropbox is performing better than expected. That's important because that's what drives the share price up! There have been 7 Q4 earnings revisions in the last 90 days and all 7 of them have been upward revisions. There has also been 9 revenue revision for Dropbox's full-year 2021 revenue in the last 90 days, 8 of which have been upward revisions. Overall, this bodes well for Dropbox's performance.

# Leaner operations

Also, I've noticed something which a lot of investors and analysts are overlooking right now, but it is extremely, extremely important in my opinion. The operating expenses of Dropbox have barely moved since December 2019 while their revenue has grown by 26% and their free cash flow has increased by 80%. Lean operations are what good tech businesses are all about so this is a really, really big plus for Dropbox in my books. Dropbox has high gross margins, currently 81% compared to the 80% last year and improving operating margins with 29.3% right now versus 23.0% last year.

# Founder is still in business

Another bullish argument for Dropbox is the fact that the founder Andrew Houston still owns almost 30% of Dropbox. That's a massive stake and shows his commitment to the company even though he did sell 9% of his total shares on 17th Nov. That's his only sale in the last 2 years though. Founders having a big stake in the company usually means that the company is still in the growth stage and the share price still has room to grow.

# Financial position

Then, let's take a look at Dropbox's cash position. They are flush with cash, absolutely loaded! They currently have $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents which is more than their debt of $1.37 billion which means that Dropbox is in a really good financial position considering that they are also profitable. Plus, Dropbox is not actually paying any interest on its long-term debt! The reason why is because they raised money using convertible notes without any interest. Instead, those notes give the loaner the opportunity to convert the notes to shares of Dropbox at the price of $35.35 and $38.25 per share. So, what is Dropbox doing with its cash? Well, first of all, they have been buying back shares. In fact, Dropbox has managed to reduce shares outstanding by 8.6% since the start of 2020. Just during the last quarter, they've bought back $181 million worth of shares! Second, they're using that cash to acquire new companies to fuel additional growth. Acquisitions can be a double-edged sword sometimes, but Dropbox has made it work so far. As I mentioned before, Dropbox bought HelloSign in February 2019 and DocSend in March 2021. The two acquisitions boosted Dropbox's capabilities and now allow them to offer a complete, full suite of self-serve products to its users.

Alright, I hope that by now we all have a pretty good understanding of what is the current situation with Dropbox. Two main questions now remain. One, is Dropbox trading at a good price. Two, what do we need to watch with Dropbox?

# Valuation

Let's look at the valuation first. Currently, Dropbox trades for a PE of 17.6 calculated using the adjusted EPS compared to the sector median of 25.3. Dropbox's forward PE is 16.5 which again lower than the sector median of 24.96. Finally, its PEG ratio is 0.53 and anything under 1 means that the stock is undervalued. The price-to-sales ratio of Dropbox is 4.66 compared to the sector's 4.08 and their forward price-to-sales are 4.36 compared to 4.14 so that's slightly higher than the median, but not by much. Dropbox also said that they expect $1 billion dollars in free cash flow by 2024, which gives us a forward price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 9 which is really, really good. Overall, Dropbox looks undervalued by several indicators right now. In terms of valuation, SimplyWallstreed gives Dropbox a fair value of $53.5 dollars based on its free cash flow. My personal EPS valuation of Dropbox gives me a more conservative figure of $40.2 dollars. Finbox's 10-year Gordon Growth model gives Dropbox an average valuation of $35.4 dollars which is near the analyst consensus of $34.5. Obviously, these are not precise targets, but the main point is that Dropbox currently appears really undervalued gives its current price of $24.7 dollars. The price of Dropbox surprisingly dipped 20% over the last 5 weeks which was strange. There was no actual obvious reason for it as Dropbox reported strong results and actually raised guidance going forward. To me, that's just a great opportunity to get a great stock at a discount!

# What to watch with Dropbox

Before we finish this off, I want to mention a few things that we need to keep an eye on with Dropbox. First of all, we need to monitor the number of paying users and the average revenue per user as we need to see steady increases there for Dropbox to justify the investment. If those numbers start to stagnate, it may be time to get out of Dropbox. Another figure to watch is the stock-based compensation. In 2020, the total stock-based compensation was $505.9 million which was more than the adjusted earnings of $409.1 million for the entire year! Dropbox is obviously no longer a startup, but it is still in a growth stage so that type of stock-based compensation is normal, but it's still good to keep an eye on it as it dilutes stock ownership. A lot of people have missed the fact that Dropbox has stock-compensation clauses for its CEO, Andrew Houston, connected to its stock price. More precisely, those stock prices are $30, $35, $40, basically on every $5 dollar increment so the more Dropbox's price goes up, the more stock-based compensation Andrew Houston will get. Finally, it looks like institutions are bullish on DBX, but a bit less so than before. The current put-to-call ratio is only 0.8 and that's up from 0.42 during the previous quarter. Essentially, a put-to-call ratio below 1 means that funds think Dropbox will go up. If that ratio goes significantly above 1, then that's one sign of bearish sentiment on the side of funds. Also, it looks like the institutional ownership of Dropbox has gone done from 84% in the last quarter to 76.6% right now. Personally, I think that's because Dropbox hit an all-time high in the latest quarter and funds took the opportunity to take some profits so I'm not that worried about the reducing ownership.

So, that's all I have to say about Dropbox for now. What do you think?

Vacasa, a vacation rental property management company, went public this week. If anyone is interested in them I wanted to share some of my industry experience on them and VRs in general. I competed with them in OR for 6 years and have met dozens of their owners and employees. 

On valuation, after-hours they were trading at a 4.13 billion market cap for ~30,000 properties. This equates to $137,700 per managed unit. Competing with them and other companies in Oregon, most small companies would sell for between $10,000 and $15,000 per unit. The company I worked for was a bottom dweller, and got some units below $7,500 at times. They‚Äôre expecting 1.25 billion in revenue for 2021 with part of the year having Turnkey‚Äôs acquisition baked in. This means revenue per house is somewhere north of around $41,666 per house before they split out their fees, which isn‚Äôt that bad. 

As this type of business scales the margin gets better and better. Managing 200+ units I had net profit margins before taxes around 10% for every dollar of revenue taken in to be split between owner and PM. At vacasa‚Äôs scale I could see them getting this north of 20%. If they were just milking the business for cash/avoiding huge IPO-related management bonuses this would put their net profit EBITA at around ~250 million with the 2021 revenue numbers. Doesn‚Äôt sound that bad, right?

The downside is they‚Äôve made a bad name for themselves, and I think organic growth will be hard to come by. Hearing from old employees, management was pretty oblivious to field conditions and field staff member complaints. In a business like this, field staff is ~80% of your employees so imagine ignoring 4/5 of your employees. I recruited HK‚Äôs from them all the time due to payroll issues, overwork, and scheduling favoritism. On the owner front, a guy with a townhome in Newport, OR actually reported they left a leak unchecked that caved in his third floor ceiling. I‚Äôve signed owners further up the coast that found meth and needles *after* their cleaning team had gone in and completed a post stay clean. Operational issues seem to continue to grow but they keep scaling. 

From a revenue perspective, much of their growth stemmed from underpricing the competition dramatically when they started up. This worked for ~5 years where they were able to produce better owner returns due to price undercutting, but competition responded. Now, most owners will produce the same or less compared to homes managed by local competitors. A homeowner I signed from them, one of the first 200, summed it up by saying there‚Äôs too many homes pulling from the same traffic. They haven‚Äôt scaled customers as they‚Äôve scaled, diluting homeowner results. 

In summary, I think the operational issues will limit organic growth, and their profit potential won‚Äôt be realized because management isn‚Äôt hungry. Why would you be, being the biggest vacation rental pm in the US? 

I‚Äôll be a buyer around $2/share, or higher if they step back from their growth plans and focus on their ground game.

Does anybody know what kind of return can be expected? They say you get half of what they charge on margin rates for people to borrow shares, but it's hard to actually get a real figure.

A) forseen a shaky time and shifted your funds into a near term target fund on the premise that it would be more conservative and fixed income driven?

The only thing I've been able to dig up is that the SEC allows companies to file a non-timely (NT) request which grants an additional 5 days. Both companies are well past that mark and one said in a statement they have 60 days from the NASDAQ letter to regain compliance, but wouldn't the SEC overrule that?

My guess is that both have unique extensions. One is doing an internal audit and the other is part of a DOJ investigation, but I was hoping someone here had some insights on the standard procedures for missed Form 10-Q filings and what that likely means for companies like these. 

* When would they be in danger of being de-listed or de-registered?

If you review these companies, you'll see a lot in common with today's ""growth"" companies like Docusign, Roblox, Teladoc, Crowdstrike, Nvidia, Tesla, Lucid Motors, Rivian, etc.

Pretty much all of the companies on this list were seeing rapid growth in revenues. Verticalnet, for example, IPOd with $3.6 Million in quarterly revenue, rising rapidly to $25 Million in quarterly revenue by 2000. This sent the stock price soaring, reaching a market cap of over $10 Billion. They even received 
an investment from Microsoft.

What was the fate of this company that was delivering consistent revenue growth, in an industry that was projected to grow immensely? 

If you invested right after the IPO when the valuation was $1.6 Billion, you would've seen your investment go up by 500%, or 6x, in roughly a year. Amazing, right? Well, suppose you continued to hold.

&gt;In 2008, Bravo Solutions acquired Verticalnet for $15.2 million.

Even after all those gains, you would've lost 99% of your initial investment over 9 years.

Look throughout the list, lots of companies are the same story. Companies reaches obscene valuation, later gets bought out for pennies on the dollar of what people paid. Lots of fast growing companies trading at many times revenues that provided terrible ROI.

But what about quality blue chip companies like Nvidia? They are profitable, and aren't going anywhere and will grow with AI and Metaverse, right?

Cisco was THE blue chip of the time to be invested in. Just as Nvidia is Powering the supposed AI and Metaverse boom, Cisco's networking equipment was powering the internet boom.

Like Nvidia, Cisco was a profitable company with good margins, so they seemed like a safe investment. 

However, if you invested in Cisco at the peak of $80/share, you would've lost more than 80% of your investment in the ensuing crash. If you held until today(2021), you'd still be down 30%, before dividends.

The takeaway here is that just because a company has grown consistently over the past few years does NOT mean they will continue to grow at that rate. Once a company gets big, competitors arise. Eventually the company captures the size of the market for their product, and growth slows considerably if they fail to continue to innovate in new areas.

Roblox, for example, is already played by over half of US kids. Where is the growth from here? The stock is trading at 35x revenues and is unprofitable. We also know consumer trends change quickly. What happens if the next generation of kids play something other than Roblox? This is a risk that isn't even priced in.

But what's the bull case? How do they possibly expand such that they produce a ROI to shareholders at current prices?

While things still aren't quite as extreme as the tech bubble was, the same principles still apply.

If you invest in any stock, you need to ask yourself ""Am I comfortable holding those for 30 years if the price tanks, only collecting dividends?"". If the answer is no, you shouldn't buy it. If you're depending on the next guy to also pay 35x revenue to buy your growth stock, you're speculating."|investing|Reviewing Wikipedia's list of .COM Bubble Companies can offer Perspective on Today's market|150.0|0.86|['Lucid Motors', 'AI', 'Metaverse', 'Docusign', 'Tesla', 'Bravo Solutions', 'Microsoft']

NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Craig Wright, a computer scientist who claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin, prevailed in a civil trial verdict Monday against the family of a deceased business partner that claimed it was owed half of a cryptocurrency fortune worth tens of billions.

A Florida jury found that Wright did not owe half of 1.1 million Bitcoin to the family of David Kleiman. The jury did award $100 million in intellectual property rights to a joint venture between the two men, a fraction of what Kleiman‚Äôs lawyers were asking for at trial.

‚ÄúThis was a tremendous victory for our side,‚Äù said Andres Rivero of Rivero Mestre LLP, the lead lawyer representing Wright.

David Kleiman died in April 2013 at the age of 46. Led by his brother Ira Kleiman, his family has claimed David Kleiman and Wright were close friends and co-created Bitcoin through a partnership.

1. Slower growth  
Stock market returns over the last 15 or so years are largely the result of boomers in their peak earning years, rushing to prepare for retirement (and recover from the '00, '08 crashes). This trend will come to an end soon, as the majority of boomers retire over the next few years, and move towards more conservative investments. Maybe dividend stocks will become interesting again. Don't expect tech stocks to keep crashing to the upside.
2. Higher interest rates  
Inflation will force interest rates up, and the resulting increase in the cost of capital will slow corporate growth. This is a tricky one, because increased interest rates could make it hard to service the national debt, which is now over 100% of GDP - maybe they *can't* go up much.
3. Higher taxes  
Because of #2, government will need more revenue to service its debt. Also, high interest will drive down bond prices, so don't buy those. We'll also need more taxes to pay for the boomers' social security and medicare, from a smaller pool working-age people (gen X).
4. Lower housing prices  
Higher interest = lower housing prices. Also, the migration of high-earning professionals to the suburbs is decreasing demand - and supply of qualified buyers. But even if SFRs drop in price, they will still be unaffordable to the majority of people, so multifamily will likely not be affected much.

So... with lower growth on the horizon, we should focus on income. Stay away from high-PE stocks, wheel the SPY, and invest the premiums in some dividend ETFs.

I'm still expecting TSLA to keep crashing to the upside, because they're doing the right things at the right time: the transition to electric transportation and self-driving are as inevitable as the rise of the internet and smartphones, and they are years ahead of the rest of the industry.

1638800665.0|0.0|t3_ra8fiy|123.0|"The next step for telecommunications around the world is 5G. In the US, the three largest providers in the field are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. The question here is can they offer us a good return on our investment? The obvious choice for industries like telecommunications are the biggest players in the country. Like I said, in the US those players are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T so lets dig in and find out which one has the best bullish case.

# Operations

Lets start with operations. The amount of wireless subscribers is probably the most important metric to look at because it gives us a good idea of whether the operations of the companies are actually expanding. Plus, it is the main and biggest source of revenue for all three of these companies. Verizon has the most subscribers, currently sitting at 121.3 million, followed by T-Mobile with 104.8 million and AT&amp;T with 97.8 million. Verizon acquired TracFone last year, which boosted their subscriber numbers, but apart from that there was no massive change in subscribers for any of the companies. Verizon has also recently broken the record for most awarded brand by JD Power for Wireless Network Quality with 27 consecutive number one awards. Good product quality is always important so that's a positive for Verizon in my books. Plus, they literally service 99% of the Fortune 500 companies and have partnerships with tech leaders like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Right now, it seems like the main priority for all three companies is to improve their 5G network and capability. T-Mobile is the leader in 5G with best download speeds and highest coverage of 295 million having access to its 5G services, out of which 140 million people having access to its fastest service . AT&amp;T's fast 5G coverage is only half T-Mobile's and Verizon is lagging behind with only a quarter of the fast 5G coverage of T-Mobile although their total coverage is similar to T-Mobile's. However, AT&amp;T's 5G has a partnership with Microsoft Azure and Verizon's 5G has partnered with AWS. Such partnerships with major cloud providers are definitely a plus.

Verizon had Verizon Media which comprised of brands like AOL and Yahoo, but Verizon sold its media assets to a private equity company called Apollo Global Management on the 1st of September. The media business was a relatively fast-growing part of Verizon so I'm personally not the biggest fan of that sale. Still, Verizon Media made up only 6.2% of Verizon's total revenue in Q2 so it is a fairly small segment, but it will affect Verizon's revenue and profit going forward. In comparison, AT&amp;T owns Warner Media so you can tell it is a much bigger chunk of its revenue at 21.2% in the third quarter of 2021. They own HBO and HBO Max which have seen an additional 12.5 million subscribers in the past year to a total of 69.4 million subscribers globally. Unfortunately, the gains there were offset by less cinema screenings over the past year although things are obviously picking back up again and we should see better results in the next quarters. Some more bad news, AT&amp;T will be spinning off Warner Media in mid-2022 so that means a big chunk of revenue will be lost next year! I think this will end up badly for AT&amp;T, especially since Warner Media is one of their more profitable segments! Putting that aside, other revenue sources include wireless equipment sales which make up 16.3% of Verizon's revenue, 12.7% of AT&amp;T's revenue and 23.8% of T-Mobile's revenue. Even though it's a big chunk of T-Mobile's revenue, the company actually saw a 5.9% decrease in wireless equipment sales while AT&amp;T saw an 11.4% increase and Verizon saw a massive 30% jump in equipment revenues, which is another plus for Verizon although the question here is whether they can actually keep that up.

# Revenue and Earnings

Alright, so we now have a good idea of what operations Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have. What does their revenue and earnings look like though? AT&amp;T has the biggest revenue at $39.9 billion in Q3 of 2021, down 5.7% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $173.6 billion, which is almost identical to the same period last year, meaning there was no growth. Verizon follows in second place with a $32.9 billion revenue in Q3 of 2021, up 4.3% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $134.2 billion which is slightly up compared to the same period last year when they had a revenue of $128.4 billion. Finally, T-Mobile brought in a revenue of $19.6 billion in Q3 of 2021 compared to $19.3 billion last year. Last year, T-Mobile saw a massive jump in revenue which was mainly because of their merger with Sprint which closed on 1st April last year, but the growth since then has been much slower. For the last 12 months, T-Mobile's revenue was $79.7 billion up from $60 billion last year, but again that's because of the two companies merging. Overall, Verizon and AT&amp;T have seen a relatively small revenue growth over the last 5 years, less than 2% per year, and they only expect a 1% revenue increase next year. In comparison, T-Mobile's revenue has doubled since 2016, which is massive compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T, but again only a small revenue increase of under 3% is expected next year. What about their earnings though? Verizon have the best net margins at 16.4% which have doubled from an 8% in 2015. Plus, Verizon raised their EPS guidance for 2021 by almost 5%. AT&amp;T's normal margins sit at around 9% although they've had a 0.7% net margin in the past year which are due to write-offs and impairments surrounding their media business. Finally, T-Mobile have the lowest margins with 4.2% right now although their historical average is about 5 or 6%. T-Mobile also have a negative free cash flow unlike the other two, which is a bit concerning. It's not a one-off either as they haven't had a positive free cash flow since 2016! That is most likely due to their faster expansion because telecommunications is extremely capital-intensive, but it is still worrying to see that with T-Mobile. In 2022, AT&amp;T is expected to see a 4.4% drop in earnings while Verizon's earnings are expected to stay essentially flat with only a 0.3% earnings growth, but T-Mobile is looking at a 39.2% earnings growth although that follows after a drop of 32% in 2021. I personally don't think we will see such a big growth from T-Mobile and, to be fair, analysts have been reducing their expectations, too. There are just a lot of uncertainties in the market and the economy and a lot can change over the next year.

# Financial Health

We can see that these companies are making a lot of cash, but how healthy are their financials? What does their debt look like? Well, surprisingly, AT&amp;T has the lowest debt-to-equity ratio with a 100%, followed by T-Mobile with 106% and finally Verizon with 191.8%! However, Verizon has the lowest effective interest rate with only 1.88% compared to 3.07% for T-Mobile and 3.31% for AT&amp;T. What that means is that even though Verizon has exactly twice the debt of AT&amp;T, their interest payments actually are not that much higher! Also, telecommunications is a very capital-intensive business so this type of debt levels are actually normal for the industry. None of the three companies has substantial cash and none of them can cover their current liabilities with their current assets. However, their quick ratios are just under 1 so the situation is not that bad.

# Dividend

Before we move to the valuation, we need to look at the dividend. Telecom stocks are not typically fast growers so their dividend is important to investors. AT&amp;T has the highest dividend at 9.4%, but they are expected to cut it by almost half next year following the sale of Warner Media. Verizon follows with a 5.1% dividend while T-Mobile does not pay a dividend at all! Both AT&amp;T and Verizon pay a higher-than-average dividend. Both of them have increased their dividend every year over the last 10 years although Verizon is the company that can actually afford to pay it. Their payout ratio is 47% whereas AT&amp;T's one is massive, 1,578% although that's skewed due to the write-offs I mentioned earlier. Still, AT&amp;T has a historically higher payout ratio than Verizon so that's worth keeping in mind. Lets also take a look at share buybacks since they are another way of returning money to shareholders. Verizon and T-Mobile have not bought back any shares in the last 3 years, but AT&amp;T has actually reduced their number of outstanding shares by 2.5% since 2018.

Okay, we've covered the dividend so lets value the companies. Are they cheap right now? Looking at their current PE, we can see that Verizon is the cheapest with 9.5, followed by T-Mobile with 39.8 and AT&amp;T with 168.2. Obviously, the current PE can be misleading, but if we take a look at their forward PE, we see that AT&amp;T is the cheapest with only 7.3, followed by Verizon with 9.6 and T-Mobile with 32. In terms of the Price-to-earnings-growth ratio, T-Mobile is the cheapest with a 1.11, followed by Verizon with 2.9 and AT&amp;T with 9.6. Finally, AT&amp;T is the cheapest in terms of book value with a PB ratio of 1.04, T-Mobile follows with 2.07 and Verizon with 2.93.

# Conclusion

How can we interpret all of this? Well, AT&amp;T seems to be the cheapest out of the three stocks right now, followed by Verizon. T-Mobile is massively overvalued right now, most likely by investors betting on T-Mobile dominating the 5G market. I honestly cannot see the bullish case for T-Mobile though. Even if they completely dominate the 5G market, they still have such low margins, negative free cash flow and a lot of costs related to capital expenditure. I just don't see them justifying this high price any time soon, definitely not in the next 2 or 3 years. Despite being cheap, AT&amp;T is also a no-go in my books. Why? Their main selling point is their dividend. AT&amp;T will be cutting this in half while also selling their high margin Warner Media subsidiary. Essentially, there is no point to hold them for the dividend and they will also lag behind in revenue and profits so there is no value play there either. It just seems like their best days are behind them. They currently trade for $22.2 which is half of their all-time high back in July 1999. 22 years ago! They have not been able to come close to that price and, in my opinion, they will not do that in the next 5 years. Definitely not worth the investment. You can just stick your money in an index fund and you will get much better returns without having to do more than 5 minutes of research. Plus, AT&amp;T's price is likely to drop further once the Warner Media sale is closed and their dividend drops. The only good purchase here is Verizon. They have a solid dividend, decent margins, they can provide stability during volatile markets. However, they are not expected to grow much. No growth typically equals no jump in price. We can value their free cash flow as much as we want, but if investors don't buy the stock, the price will lag behind the S&amp;P. Still, I think there is a case for Verizon if we see continued inflation or an increase in interest rates. As I said, Verizon's dividend is also solid, which is great for income portfolios or for balancing out your risk. However, if you are looking for price appreciation, a simple US index fund like SPY or VGT will probably outperform Verizon. There are some companies that can offer you a better return so check out my stock picks here if you are interested. Let me know what you think about Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile down below.

P.S. This is one of the occasions where you spend a weekend researching companies only to come to the conclusion that S&amp;P500 probably offers better returns!

&gt;Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, the Company has agreed to sell approximately 1.17 million shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase 1.17 million shares of common stock. The warrants will be exercisable immediately upon the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $17.50 per share. The warrants will expire five years from the date of issuance. The purchase price for one share of common stock and one corresponding warrant will be $17.50. The gross proceeds to the Company from the private placement are estimated to be approximately $20.5 million before deducting the placement agent's fees and other estimated offering expenses. The offering is expected to close on or about December 3, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

So if I'm reading this right, LGVN sold 1.17m shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 1.17m shares with a strike price of $17.50 for a gross proceed of $20.5 million (the wording isn't exactly clear -- the warrants have a strike price of $17.50 for sure but were the common stocks sold for $17.50 each as well? I would assume so).

1.17 \* $17.50 = $20.475 million. That means the premium of the warrants cost 0.025million or $25,000 or basically none relative to the stock value. Is this a common thing when it comes to private placements? Don't warrants usually have much higher premiums? Am I missing something?

""Recently, individual media reports that Chinese regulators will prohibit companies with variable interest entity (VIE) structures from listing abroad and promote the delisting of Chinese companies listed in the US are completely misunderstood and misinterpreted,"" the statement said.

""We leaned that some domestic companies are actively communicating with domestic and foreign regulatory agencies to promote listing in the United States,"" according to the statement.

""We believe that as long as regulators on both sides continue to uphold this principle of mutual respect, rationality, pragmatism and professional mutual trust in conducting dialogue and consultation, we will be able to find a mutually acceptable path of cooperation,"" according to the statement.

In fact, China and the US have been cooperating in the field of audit and supervision of China concept stocks, and had also explored effective ways of cooperation through pilot inspections, laying a better foundation for cooperation between the two sides.

However, some US political forces have politicized capital market regulation in recent years, suppressing Chinese companies listed in the US for no apparent reason and coercing Chinese companies to delist, which is not only contrary to the basic principles of market economy and the concept of the rule of law, but also damages the interests of global investors and the international status of the US capital market, the statement said.

In the past week when equity markets sold off because of Fed tapering fears and lower then expected nonfarm payrolls, bitcoin also went down almost 20%.

I'm not judging those that want to speculate on cryptos, just don't call it a safe haven. If anything it's a risk-on asset which follows more the sentiment in stocks.

If you want a safe haven right now **consider 5-10% gold in portfolio.** Most probably hold an ETF like $GLD for that. Gold futures went up more than a percent on friday.

For those that will point out gold didn't go up in the past 10 years, that's because the Fed kept printing money which has helped bloating the stock market. Fed already announed they will finally taper off this QE and might even want to do it faster. **Over longer periods of time like the past 20 and 30 years gold has even outperformed the S&amp;P500.**

This phrase is usually misinterpreted to mean that if you buy a risky stock, you‚Äôll have a higher chance of getting a higher reward in the future. This is not what it refers to. The meaning of the phrase is revealed through an understanding of the difference between compensated and uncompensated risk. 

-	Compensated risk is when you take a higher risk that is compensated through a higher expected return. An example is stocks vs bonds. Stocks are systematically more risky than bonds, and over the long run they provide a higher return. Another example is that of small cap stocks. There‚Äôs been a lot of research done into the systematic higher risks associated with certain stocks that have certain factors. These stocks should provide a greater return over the long run. Search up factor investing to learn more about this.
-	Uncompensated risk is when you take a higher risk that is not compensated through a higher expected return. Individual stocks are examples of an uncompensated risk. You take on the risk of the individual company performing poorly and there‚Äôs no logical reason why it should lead to expected outperformance. The risks of an individual company are mitigated through the use of diversification. An individual stock on average will give you the market average return. But that individual stock has a higher risk. If you hold 10 stocks, then on average you get the same return but you have mitigated your risk. This is the theory behind index investing.

I bonds = protects buying power by providing an interest rate based on the last 6 months inflation, the current rate on i-bonds is 7.12% and get adjusted every 6 months, i understand the number could go down on me but with how things are going i dont think its likely inflation is going to slow down in the next bit, and even if it does i wont actually lose money unless the rate becomes sub .5% which isn't going to happen. maximum amount you can own is 10k (more if you get paper bonds through your tax return but that's another discussion)

my 401k is through fidelity, i can take out loan with a 5.25% interest rate for 12 to 60 months and from what I understand the interest paid actually goes into my 401k, so its technically not really a fee just mandatory additional deposit into my savings, they DO mention a 50 dollar setup fee when I use their loan calculator though.

plan:

1. take out loan on 401k for 12 months
2. invest the loan into a 12 month ibond
3. pay the bi-monthly loan payments, reimburse myself when the I-bond matures in 12 months

Expected results (Using current I-bond rate):

$712 total earnings from I-bond

$525 of that will be put into the 401k (the interest paid on the loan)

\-$50 dollar loan fee

summary: extra $525 invested into my 401k, $137 in pocket. Total profit of $662 with 0% risk (i will easily cover the loans monthly bill)

I understand this isn't much but I like to maximize my financial opportunities

Questions:

1. how does paying loans early work? could I do the max timeframe on the 401k loan (60 months) but pay it in full at the 12 month mark when the I-bond matures? I'd like to minimize the monthly payments as much as possible but I don't know if this has a downside or can even be done
2. am i right that the 5.25% interest on the fidelity loan goes into my 401k and thus is really just more savings for me as im not actually losing money by paying it?"|investing|any flaws in this plan? loan on my 401k|0.0|0.38|['DO', 'B.', '401k']
1638582544.0|0.0|t3_r8emkv|7.0|"Fellow investors,

I am out of new investing idea, so for this post I'd like to discuss something that is often ignored: How much money do you need to have in your portfolio to make it worth your while as an individual-stock picker? Central to this question is the opportunity cost that all stock pickers go up against: the almighty index funds!!

Simple enough, your performance over the long run needs to be judged against a broad-market index fund, for which you incur no sweat and no effort holding.

**Assumptions** (these are meant to simplify the calculation of opportunity cost):

1. **You derive no net intrinsic benefit from your action of picking stocks** (so no net emotional rewards, no net benefit in learning and gaining experience as a stock picker, no pain or suffering seeing your stock picks going down, or all of this even out in the long run). You can relax this assumption and add it to your total return if you derive some net benefit from this stock picking.
2. **You gain a long-run 2% outperformance over the index**. Considering that most money managers lose to the index in the long run after fees, this is a very generous assumption. But you need an outperformance assumption to even have a discussion about stock picking making financial sense.

\*\*\*another baby assumption: **you did not obtain this outperformance for free**. Eg., you did not outperform by simply getting free stock tips from friends or works, etc.

3. **You're an average American with $63,500 in annual salary**. Needless to say, if you're high paying worker, stock picking makes even less sense for your opportunity cost. At 40hr/week for 50 weeks, this comes down to $32.5/hr wage.

4) **You derive no net benefit from obtaining uncorrelated returns**. Many of the benefits touted by hedge funds is not that it beat the indexes, but that it give investors ""uncorrelated returns."" So during bear or bull market, funds will have different returns compared to the indexes.

5) **You have no additional transaction costs picking stocks over indexes**. Easy enough in this zero-fee environment. Note: does not apply to pay-for-order flow brokers.

6)??? I probably missed something. But these will do.

**Calculation**:

So, at 2% outperformance, you will make an extra $200 with a $10,000 portfolio, $2000 with a $100,000, $20,000 with a $1,000,000, etc.

As you can see, at $63,500 annual salary opportunity cost, you will need $3,1785,00 in total portfolio value for your effort to make sense, assuming that you treat stock picking as a full-time job.

My Excel game is no longer what it was, so I am too lazy to create a line chart that could visualize this. Imagine that the 2% extra return of your portfolio grow as your total portfolio grow. That line needs to cross the $63,500 in opportunity cost before it even makes sense for you to consider stock picking as a full time job.

Now, let's say you don't need 40 hr/week to consistently outperform the market. So instead let's say you need 20 hr/week. That would mean you need $1,892,500 in total portfolio value to make a difference financially as a stock pickers.

Further reducing the workweek to 10 hr/week, it would be $946,250 as the point of excess return over opportunity cost.

**What's my point?** TL;DR: It means that for a lot of investors, including yours truly, it doesn't make financial sense until you become a multimillionaire to be picking stocks, even if you truly have a consistent edge over the market.

Obviously, if you can relax any of these assumption in your favor, that change the calculus. For me it's assumption 1) that made a difference. What's yours?"|investing|How Much Does Your Portfolio Need To Be To Make It Worthwhile As A Stockpicker?|7.0|0.58|[]

**What is asset allocation?**  It is you mix of:  Stocks/ bonds/ cash/ alternative investments.  Each of those are ""super asset"" classes.  That means they are fundamentally different then another one when it comes to return/ risk/ correlation coefficients (how one zigs when others zag).  

**Why is it important?**  Asset allocation is how one controls risk in your portfolio.  Early on folks spend a lot of time thinking about return, but as you learn about investing (via books/ financial theory and frankly your own experience) you realize focusing on controlling risk is MORE important.  It is more under control unlike returns..  There was a landmark paper published several years ago basically stating, 90% of all short term volatility is related to asset allocation.  It is one of the fundamental ways an investor has to limit volatility (standard deviation of returns).

This decision on asset allocation is by FAR the single most important decision an investor will make.  Harry Markowitz (father on modern portfolio theory) won a Nobel Prize in 1994 based on his work on the matter.  So yeah it is pretty important.

So lets get started...

A lot of the below is an amalgam of different folk's opinions.  A good spot to start comes from:  Larry Swedroe (well known financial author) wrote (paraphrasing):  Your asset allocation is decided by one's willingness, ability, and need to take risk.  

**Willingness** to take risk is based on how much your stomach can handle volatility (market going down). Easy rule of thumb is to assume your portfolio can drop in any given year 50% by the amount dedicated to stocks. For example, if you have a $100k portfolio and are 80/20 (stocks/ bonds) assume you can lose 40% in an given year. So if this is you, don't be surprised if your portfolio drops to $60k (loss of 40k) at any given year.  If that is TOO MUCH for you to handle you need to dial down the amount dedicated to stocks.

**Need** to take risk is how much return you need to get to your ""number"". That is hard for any young investor to figure out as they are YEARS away from retirement. If you are closer to retirement look through your last couple of years of spending and figure out your ""number"" per year needed. Then, take that number and subtract out SS+ any pensions+ any annuity from your ""number"". That delta needs to be covered by your personal investments. Then, figure out how much you will need to return so you can take out 4%/ year to meet that ""number"". Trinity study give a basis of the 4% which would have worked as well through the worst stretch in U.S. history (70's) so good enough to use.

**Ability** to take risk is all based on your:  Need for liquidity while that money is invested, stability of job. and time horizon. 

1.  Liquidity means only invest money you don't need until the end of the time horizon you are investing. If you are getting married, buying house, saving for retirement then EACH should have a different asset allocation as they all have different time horizons.  This is why it simply does NOT matter what happens until that time horizon is up since you don't need access to that money until then end of that specific time horizon. 
2. Stability of job is a BIG one that no one thinks about. I would say there are more folks with the stomach to handle volatility then there are folks who have a stable job that would allow them to handle the volatility. If the market crashes folks may be okay with losing large sums of money during a bear market, BUT the issue is businesses usually contract during these times which means you get fired at the same time. That means you have to dip into your investments to live off the SAME time your investments are at lows. This can be protected by having a emergency fund of 6M- 1yr if one has a unstable career IF you are going to be heavy in stocks or 3-6m EF for more balanced asset allocations.  Unless you are a doctor, tenured teacher, government worker, etc.. you will likely get fired at some point in your life (usually at the worst possible time) so be prepared for it with your investing plan ahead of time. 
3. Time horizon... below is a quick table for the MAX asset allocation based on different time horizons... Money needed in...

0-2 years: 100% cash

2-4: 20/80 (s/b)

4-6: 40/60

6-8: 60/40

8-10: 80/20

10+ years: 100% stocks

What is Wash trading?

A crypto currency/coin is just an crypto secured code. Does nothing. Just cryptographed code.So you see the listed market price for a coin?

Basically you can make them go up or down with bidding a higher price then the listed price and executing the trade. (establishing a new market price)

So someone launches a coin, then they open two or several accounts. And they simply buy the coin, by moving money from one account to the other. Pushing up the listed market price... So it was worth 0$ then now they've moved it up as much as they could with all the money they had.Obviously, if the market price gets high enough they can no longer afford to move the price up past $100 if they can only move $100 back and forth between two accounts, buying and selling it.

Someone else see the market price and says wowwww the price is going up I better buy. Then they simply sell them coins at the price. It gains momentum when people keep buying into it then when the price is high enough and they see not much more people are buying into it, they simply selll allllllll the coins they have stored pushing the price down to 0 to capture all of pending bid prices. And leaving people who bought these ""coins"" with a code with a listed market value of 0.This is essentially how ""rug pulls"" work. (i.e. the Squid Game token going to 0 and countless others)

But is bitcoin/ethereum etc. operating the same way????Here is a live trading dashboard of bitcoin: [https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC\_USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT)See how trades are being executed multiple times a second, setting the listed price.

They need you to buy into it for a reason. Hence, the heavily promoted lies, and aggressive marketing. Of course, they seem to need you to buy but never sell.

When the price of bitcoin/ethereum tanked hard, a lot of these exchanges literally shutdown, there by locking people out of their accounts, preventing these people from selling and effectively stealing people's money... They've (coin base, kraken, kukoo etc.) have done this numerous times this year.

So I ask, if you're ""investing"" in this heavily marketed, energy draining, digital code, with no real world benefit to the economy are you really just playing the game - buy in and dump on others before the people with large amounts of money can dump on you or is there some kind of real economic driver driving up the price of these coins?"|investing|"What is a compelling reason to see Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies as an investment and not a ""hustle"" or ""bet""?"|196.0|0.76|[]

One of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is ‚Äúbuy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan‚Äù. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it‚Äôs horrible advice. 

In 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It‚Äôll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let‚Äôs say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you‚Äôll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you‚Äôre stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. 

What makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that‚Äôs only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn‚Äôt let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. 

Buyer beware on ARK and if you‚Äôre a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell. Good luck to all."|investing|Cathie Wood has everyone fooled with her 5 year plans|947.0|0.82|['Microsoft - MSFT', 'Cathie Wood', 'NASDAQ', 'ARK', 'Cathie', 'Tesla']

We all know of the saying 'time in the market is better than timing the market'. Even though this is historically correct it is still psychologically hard to stay 100% invested when many think the market is overvalued. But it is also painful to see the market keep going up as you hold a bunch of cash doing nothing but losing value to inflation.

For this discussion I am talking about an investor who basically is just buying S&amp;P500 index funds. So what is an alternative to holding 20% cash and waiting for the dip?

#Alternative to Holding 20% Cash

Hold 100% index funds. 0% cash

If the market keeps going up, great! You are maximizing your profits.

If the market crashes then what? Sell 10% of your S&amp;P500 funds and buy leveraged S&amp;P500 index funds at 2x or 3x. Of course the success of this depends on how good you can judge if the market is reasonably near a bottom. But the same can be said about someone with 20% cash and waiting for a dip.



#You need to be correct TWICE if you hold 20% Cash

To me this is better than holding 20% cash and waiting for a dip. Why? Because if you are holding for a dip you need to be correct TWICE. First you need to be correct when you make the decision that you are going to hold 20% cash. You need to know the market is overheated. This is very hard to do. 

#Many people thought the market was overvalued in 2016. The S&amp;P500 is up 100% since then.

The second time you need to be right is when you decide to buy the dip. Are you sure this is really the bottom or reasonably near to it? If you are wrong then you could get burned twice.

So holding 20% Cash you need to be right TWO TIMES: when you decide to hold cash and when you decide to buy the dip.

In contrast if you hold 100% index funds you only have to be correct once. When the market crashes you have to decide when it is reasonably near the bottom and then you can exchange 10% of your 1x index for 2x or 3x index.

Personally I don't believe in waiting for a dip or buying 2x index. But if someone is thinking of going 20% cash this might be a good alternative."|investing|Alternative to waiting for the DIP and holding CASH.|81.0|0.79|[]

Chinese ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing said it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange, accelerating China‚Äôs decoupling from US capital markets as Beijing cracks down on the country‚Äôs leading technology groups.

The company, which has been hit by increased regulatory scrutiny in China, wrote on its official Weibo account on Friday that it would begin the process of delisting and prepare to go public in Hong Kong.

Didi said in a separate statement its board had authorised the delisting in New York of its American depositary shares ‚Äúwhile ensuring that ADSs will be convertible into freely tradable shares of the Company on another internationally recognised stock exchange‚Äù.

Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Tech index fell as much as 2.7 per cent on Friday following the news. Ecommerce group Alibaba dropped as much as 5.4 per cent and internet group Tencent lost as much as 3.3 per cent.

Didi launched its $4.4bn New York initial public offering in June, making it the biggest listing by a Chinese company in the US since Alibaba in 2014. Days later, Chinese regulators ordered Didi‚Äôs app to be taken off domestic app stores. The company was also banned from signing up new users and subjected to a wide-ranging government investigation into its cyber security practices.

The group‚Äôs shares have tumbled from the June IPO price of $14 to $7.80 at the New York close on Thursday. They initially rose in pre-market trading on Friday, but later gave up those gains.

While big Chinese state-owned enterprises listed in the US have been targeted by the Biden and Trump administrations with investment bans, New York remained an attractive destination for China‚Äôs private-sector tech champions.

In the immediate aftermath of Didi‚Äôs IPO, Chinese regulators signalled that other companies hoping to follow in its wake would be subject to more stringent approval procedures, especially if they managed data deemed sensitive by Beijing."|investing|China‚Äôs Didi to delist from New York and switch to Hong Kong (full article in comment)|310.0|0.95|['the New York Stock Exchange', 'Didi‚Äôs', 'Tencent', 'Didi‚Äôs IPO']

(please spare me the point where somebody chimes in and the top voted comment is ""go see a financial advisor"". no duh. common sense. this is just hypothetical/to prove a point in a unique situation. if anything, i'm saying, hey r/investing, let's pretend to be financial advisors and see how well we would do in this context)

You already have a ton of exposure to stocks. ETFs/mutual funds, track the index, yada yada.

If you can pull in ~$620k/yr gross, $450k/yr net (25% operating expenses), write off 2.2% depreciation of the purchase price from 5 years ago (about $3.7m-$4.5m), and also benefit from the compounding appreciation of roughly 3% a year on $8m ($240k/yr the first year)... does this make sense?

Context: the buildings are paid off. No financing/mortgage/interest.

I am not sure if this is wrong but... running a cap rate calculator based on the *current* market value of the properties is 5.6%.

To me... that's bad. But is this all an example of how ""what you read online doesn't really apply all of the time/it depends on other factors"". You could do better by *not* being a landlord, not having tenants, not having to maintain buildings, sell the buildings for $8m, clear $7m after fees/closing costs, and put it in the market at 10% (before inflation).

But... is this proof that... high net worth individuals are willing to take ""less return"" in the name of diversification?

I would say the returns are relatively neck-and-neck when you take into account tax deductions (net about $30k in the 37% bracket), appreciation added to net income (another $240k on top in appreciation of $450k is a big deal. That's generating almost $700,000/yr net on $8m in capital being tied up, plus the $30k in tax deductions makes it about $730k/yr).

Is it a no brainer to do commercial real estate instead of stocks in this case? Am I reading too heavily into ""5.6% cap rate is bad"". Is cap rate for people who don't have the buildings paid off? Could I (in this hypothetical situation) command higher rent given the cap rate?

**Edit**: Thank you for being so helpful with the info! The first couple responses I got were pretty toxic and condescending, but I'm glad to see that those comments were absolutely downvoted and that the community is more supportive than what those first few comments suggested. 

Based on some responses I've seen, I'm getting the idea that this community is against hiring tax professionals (at least for simpler things like this). Is that the case or am I misunderstanding?"|investing|With tax season coming up, how do investment taxes work?|156.0|0.82|[]

As we all know, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that inflation may keep rising as we head into 2022. Growing fears over this rise in the annual inflation rate are justifiable, as this number was at 4.4% in September 2021 and now is at 6.2% after October 2021. As a result, many investors and businessmen are nervous that we might be approaching a recession in the near future. We will attempt to look at various indicators and data from 2008, right before the Great Recession, to compare and contrast to the present day.
	First, how can we even define a recessionary period? Recessions generally arise from weakness in demand; however, issues with supply can also trigger economic dismay. Recessions come from a period of time where economic activity has become severely reduced, which can be statistically identified by falls in GDP in two consecutive quarters. Real GDP has increased by 6.7% in Q2 and 2.1% in Q3, indicating no worries of a recession at this moment (Bureau of Economic Analysis). However, there are some signs that we may be approaching this economic collapse very soon. 
	We should look to aggregate supply and demand to attempt to diagnose the future of the American economy. As we have seen in 2021, the economy has had no problem reacting to increases in aggregate demand: Congress just passed their $1.2 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, and consumers have more than enough money as a result of increased salaries, stimulus checks, and unemployment insurance. However, supply chain problems have sprung up as a result of almost too much demand, and companies have had a hard time keeping up. Nearly 40% of small businesses have supply chain delays as a result of the pandemic, and there has been a 14% increase in supply chain disruptions between 2019 and 2020 (Zippia). Clearly, there are issues with the aggregate supply that could worsen in the near future, with rising inflation allowing for a negative output gap between the availability of supply-side producers to deliver for demand-side consumers."|investing|Comparing macro trends from 08 to 21|43.0|0.8|['Congress', 'Bureau of Economic Analysis', 'Federal Reserve']

So Intel seems to be one of those tech underdogs who no one thinks will perform well in the future because they haven't been innovative at all in the past few years compared to companies like AMD and such. To me, this looks like a long-term buy opportunity:

-  Financials look pretty healthy from what I know.

- 2.80% dividend yield is a big nice-to-have if you're gonna hold the stock patiently for a few years.

- P/E ratio is one of the lowest in the tech market right now, meaning that the company has a lot of room to grow if the expectations become optimistic. And in the case of a market crash, it would be one of the safest bets in the tech market because of its healthy P/E ratio (correct me if I'm wrong on this one).

- They announced an increase in capital spending for the next year, so they are likely trying to get back the ground that they've lost in their technological advancement.

- They're soon going to compete in the discrete GPU market too, so that can't do them any wrong.

- With their own semiconductor foundries, they have an upper edge in manufacturing costs and can avoid a lot of supply chain related issues. And with the never-ending chip shortage, they might be able to make more chips at more affordable costs than AMD and Nvidia, who are bound in their production by TSMC's production capacity. Surely, their manufacturing processes are not as good as TSMC and Samsung's 5-7 nm processes, but it looks like they plan on catching up with them within the next few years. 

- They still have their place in the lower-end desktop/mobile CPU market, as their lower-end CPU's are much cheaper than AMD's. They offer the cheapest CPU's with integrated graphics on the market right now. Even if they don't grow anytime soon, I doubt they will run out of revenue sources, especially with the chip shortage going on.

My plan would be to hold the stock for a few years and cash in those nice dividends while waiting for the stock to become a growth one. I think Intel has already reached its floor price, and it would be very unlikely that the stock price goes any lower considering that it has strong fundamentals.

&gt;Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

&gt;This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)

While it‚Äôs easy to say that it‚Äôs all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let‚Äôs first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert ‚Äî there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov‚Äô21, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-‚Äô00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‚ÄòMoney printer go brrr‚Äô)**

[1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

[Research by Goldman Sachs](https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it‚Äôs highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO‚Äôs this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ‚Äô21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors‚Äô desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO‚Äôs just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don‚Äôt grow as per expectations.

Now that‚Äôs a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it‚Äôs a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let‚Äôs look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

**New Investors**

It‚Äôs no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

**What‚Äôs the implication?**

As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.

**Conclusion**

The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.

But, that‚Äôs not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.

The expected annual return by investors [above inflation is a whopping 17.5%](https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97)(which is 161% more than what is realistic) ‚Äî This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.

Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.

Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‚Äò98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.

It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!

&gt;Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves

These sessions involve a horse interacting with a person, both of whom were abused/neglected in the past, and both parties gain from it. The person, who presumably may have suffered some form of mental trauma before, learns more about themselves and develops a bond with the horse. The horse experiences the care and warmth of a parent-like figure that they may lack in their lives.   


Each session costs 300 AUD, and this price is already below the cost per session. Feeding the horses, paying the rent for the horses' occupancy, and paying the employees to take care of the horses costs a lot. My job is to look for sources of funding for this organization so they can cover their costs with the subsidy they get from the investors. 

They have no debt, but this organization does not generate profit. An investor cannot expect anything of monetary value in return for their investment into the organization. What they can expect is increased access to equine therapy sessions and growing awareness about a niche form of therapy that is genuinely helpful. What sort of investors would suit this project best?  


Is government funding better or should I approach private investors as well?

1638302868.0|0.0|t3_r5w4ax|6.0|"Fellow investors,

I provided the first update on my short thesis a few days ago ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/r2odo0/the\_final\_oil\_short\_of\_2021\_update\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/r2odo0/the_final_oil_short_of_2021_update_1/))

Today, oil spot price and the market at large continue to have problem digesting the COVID news, with WTI continuing to fall to $65/bbl (just $2 away from the lows during Delta wave). Yesterday, I gave it a 60/40 that oil price would continue to slide when it was at $70/bbl.

As I have closed my put position, the only thing remaining is where to initiate a long position on my favorite ""best in breed"" O&amp;G. What is surprising to me is that the oil stocks have all shown a lot of resiliency in the face of sharp corrections in spot price (contrary to what happened during Delta, when oil stock was almost in lockstep with spot price). This could be due to a couple reasons: (a) the oil market is predicting that the current correction will be short-lived; (b) the spot market got a little bit ahead of itself during the October runup so now we're seeing the unwinding of those trades; (c) the oil stocks have proved that they are still generating an awful lot of cash even when WTI was at $62/bbl so investors are more willing to hold now; (d)-(z)???. 

Past history with Delta suggests that we still have a bit more runway for things to get worse in the medical/epidemiology sense before it gets better with cases and sentiment. So far, news on Omicron indicate that the virulence of the virus might decrease but it can spread faster than other strain. Moderna CEO stated that he didn't think the current vaccines will provide the same level of immunization for Omicron.

Despite all of the bad news during Delta, market recovered within weeks of the Delta's bottom. My conclusion is that my oil short thesis (now that oil is just $2 away from the Delta's lowest point) no longer has the same degree of margin of safety that it did when oil was at $80/bbl and the world was clearly heading toward another COVID wave. Within the next couple days, I will observe and start to add to my long position on US producers. However, I give it a 60/40 that oil stocks still have some room to fall from here if spot price trades sideway at this level for a while.

Edit: US' new cases hit 216k yesterday, maybe the result of the pend up cases during the long holiday? I still think it is clear that another wave is coming to the US."|investing|The Final Oil Short of 2021- Update 2|6.0|0.6|['Omicron', 'Delta']

The strategy involves buying the same number of shares (or if cash is tight you can buy calls) of the stock you already own but it's down for the year.  You then sell the original shares on Dec 31.

I have a question, however, this strategy will work if the market continues to go up between now and then, but if market tanks between now and Dec 31 wouldn't this strategy just double up your losses?

Why not just sell your losers at the end of the year and then buy back 31 days later?

1638288447.0|0.0|t3_r5qkrn|512.0|"For those who want to invest in oil stocks, a piece of the puzzle that you cannot ignore is the fact that US producers have differing strategies for hedging oil price movement, potentially limiting both their upside/downside. Despite a record FY2021 of operational cash flow, many of the US oil stocks are sitting on big a pile of unrealized losses due to their hedging. Don't be fooled by management's obfuscation. This is real loss that need to be dealt with at some point. 

This hedging could partly explain why, even though when WTI rallied to $80/bbl, oil stocks still languish at 30-60% below their pre-COVID levels (and also because the companies ate away a lot of shareholder's equity to survive COVID).   

Even if you're bullish on oil price and want to invest in the oil stocks, you need to look at the way the companies you invested in have their hedging strategies. One of the thing I predicted is that the upstreamers will start diverging in performance come 2022 because of their hedging strategies starting to diverge significantly. Many of them have stated during earning calls that they will no longer hedged at the same level as they did in 2021, thus making their income stream more affected by a rise or fall in oil price. 

If you look at the chart in the WSJ link below:

Most of the oil companies on the chart hedged about 50-75% of their total production in 2021, thus severely limiting their upside when oil price rose. Come 2022, some companies have stated that they will no longer hedge most of their production going forward. This could be a blessing or a curse depending on what oil price will be in 2022. One thing is for certain: you can't rest on your laurels just buying any US producers without thinking about their hedging strategies."|investing|For Those Who Want to Invest in Oil Companies: You Need to Know their Hedging Strategies|512.0|0.9|['WSJ']

1638248677.0|0.0|t3_r5fe1a|32.0|"This post will detail my ideas of how buybacks are far superior than the value of dividends.  

A company can do a couple different things to issue a monetary reward to its shareholders.  The first, is to issue a dividend.  A shareholder gets a monetary amount for holding a stock. 

Say a company who's stock is worth $10 a share, with a total of 1 million shares, issues a $1 dividend.  The company is *not* actually now worth $9 a share as some people would be led to believe, as there is a greater than zero chance that shareholders have automatic dividend reinvesting, or will use those dividends to buy more shares of the same company.  This isn't always true because a company's sentiment and such can lead it to go higher or lower than expected due to dividends, so you can't always predict the movement of a company based on an issuing dividend.  

The problem with a dividend issuance from a company is that it gives the shareholder a choice of what to do with the money -- go buy a new pair of shoes, go out for a nice meal, or buy shares from a different company.  That means there is a less than 100% chance that those funds will be reinvested to buy shares.

This is where buybacks come in.  Companies can buy back shares at any point they would like, whenever they feel like it would best benefit the company.  

Say we have the same scenario, a company's stock is worth $10 and they buy back the same amount that the dividend would have been, 1 million dollars.  So the company is now worth $11, right?  Wrong again chief.

There is such thing as velocity of money in asset purchases.  The amount of money spent on a company in stocks increases the value of the company much more than the money spent.

Microsoft currently trades around 24 million shares a day in volume, and they have 7.5 billion issued shares.  That's about 9.5% of its total market cap traded per month.  A spike of buying power over a short period of time, say a few weeks, would significantly boost the companies growth.  I didn't calculate other companies average daily volume but for the sake of the experiment I chose the biggest company in the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq.  

Now dividends also have the same bonus. Money reinvested in the company also gives the velocity effect of volume spikes giving more value than what is spent, however those that do decide to reinvest their dividends don't all do so in sync and at the most opportune time, not quite creating the most efficient use of velocity, therefore making the buyback the more efficient use of capital, even when dividend reinvest percentage would be at 100%, which just doesn't happen.

Losing the amount of shares you own when you sell doesn't matter.  You can sell fractional shares when you need to sell to get the amount of capital you need.  All that matters in investing related to this topic is the total value of your portfolio. 

Currently and in the past long term capital gains are always taxed better than dividend payments, and the investor gets to decide when to sell.  For most of us, taking too many dividends isn't an issue but as you get older and have had enough dividend bearing stocks over the years, yearly dividends could be more income than you planned on taking, so you end up paying taxes you wouldn't have rather paid if a company was issuing buybacks the whole time."|investing|Buybacks vs issuing dividend -- the breakdown.|32.0|0.76|['Microsoft']

1638227485.0|0.0|t3_r58ddh|16.0|"The stakeholders in a VC fund are, more or less, the GPs managing the fund and choosing which companies to invest in, the LPs providing the money, and the companies being invested in.

However, I'm not sure I understand who exactly owns what exactly. Let's try to work it through with a simple example:

- Fund A has 4 employees. Even though it doesn't matter, let's say there's one lawyer, one accountant, and two analysts / managers.
- Fund A has a partnership with 10 LPs, each contributing $1M for a total of $10M.
- Fund A has asset management fees of 2% - I read that this is quite common.
- Fund A is/wants to invest in 5 companies, with a target of around $2M for a 25% ownership stake each.

How exactly does the flow of money works now, who owns what? 

If the 2% fee is accurate, it means that the 4 employees have exactly $200k to share as salary, or $50k each. Since VC investments tend to be locked up for a long time, let's assume that the 5 investments will not be exited until 5 years later. So, really, the VC employees will take fees of $10M*2%*5=$1M, or in other words, need 10% of committed capital just for their sustenance. On the flipside, this means that the LPs are really getting returns on only $900k, not $1M - their returns are negative by quite a bit just by virtue of paying a fee without having returns. 

Furthermore, that only leaves $9M to be invested. If we divide that evenly across the 5 startups, that's $1.8M, and let's just say we'd still get 25% stake for that.

So now, year 0, fund A has five 25% ownership stakes, as well as $1M in cash to cover their salaries in the coming 5 years. Next question... Who really owns the stakes? Does each of the 10LPs own 2.5% of the 5 companies, directly in their name? Or just 2% because the fund will take an additional 20% (I heard it as the 20% rule) stake for their own profits? Let's say the latter is true, is everything still in the name of the VC, until they exit the investments? Or can LPs choose to sell their part of the share early? 

Let's say one of the five startups, which was implicitly valued at $1.8M/.25=$72M, is now worth $70.2M 5 years later, and the other 4 investments went bust. The 25% ownership is worth $18M, or a 80% return over 5 years, or rather around 16% return a year (but only paid after 5 years). So now the VC gets $3.6M to share, and the LPs each get $1.44M, for a 5-year-return of 44%, or a yearly return of around 8%, which is probably worse than the S&amp;P500?

I've been reading a lot lately about how investing a couple of hundred a month into a broad index fund, say one that tracks the S&amp;P 500 (e.g. VOO), could very well yield a lot of money if held for a good 30-50 years due to compounding interest.

The truth is taking big risks when you are young is more risky because of opportunity costs. People always mention compounding interest over decades. But fail to apply this to investing in risky stocks when you are young. 

Lets say you are 20 years old and you have $10k to invest. Its common to hear people say you can be more risky since you are so young. And even if you do YOLO and lose it all you can easily recover. But think opportunity cost. What did you really lose doing a YOLO?

$10,000

Invest in an index fund that returns 8.5% annualized return 

Withdraw at 65 years old

That $10k becomes $400k. So you basically lost $400k because you YOLOed on a risky stock.

If you hold till 70 you lost $600k.

12% Emerging Markets

After doing some portfolio backtesting I came to the conclusion that with a portfolio like mine the worst loss you can take is about 60% which was in 2008. I'm still very young, however, I really doubt that we'll see anything like that again.

I'm planning to leave my old portfolio of about 100K as it is and start a new one from scratch using the same allocations on IBKR.

The reason for this is that I've been investing since 2018 and know I can stomach volatility easily and wouldn't mind adding some more volatility for an increase in return. 

Margin fees are at 2.5% on IBKR (And lower for bigger portfolios). Taking the past performance of this portfolio, I can't imagine we go through a long period where this isn't met. However, this isn't fixed and could be increased in the future, if that is the case then I would de-leverage depending on the fee rate.

I plan to use an initial margin of 80% (For every $100 I buy IBKR gives me $25 extra). 

The overnight maintenance margin on IBKR is 50%, meaning that for me to get margin called, I would need my portfolio to go down by 60%. As stated, this portfolio is going to be new, and I'll be putting money from whatever I save monthly into it, so even if I'm the worst market timer in the world averaging in will prevent me from buying at the top when such a 60% drop happens.

And if such a situation were to happen, I can always transfer a part of my old portfolio and put it on  IBKR to increase collateral.

* Why is gold not keeping up with inflation?
* Is crypto de-monetizing gold?
* Why is gold (or crypto) so volatile when they are supposed to be stores of value?

A lot of folks who invest in these asset classes do not truly understand why their investments are moving up or down in value. To make matters worse the ratio of shady or idiot gold/crypto pumpers are doing investors no favors. I'm hoping this post can clear a bunch of misconceptions.

First, what do gold, BTC, ETH have in common? All are sound money, or another way to put it is they are nobody else's liability. Bonds are liabilities to a corporation. Cash (i.e. USD) is a liability to a central bank. Insofar as folks may want to protect themselves from central bank liabilities, crypto and gold share similar appeal.

This is where comparison should stop. Repeat after me... **""Gold is a classical currency. Crypto is an emerging currency.""** Let's park crypto aside for a few and explain what it means to be a classical currency. 

Gold, as a classical currency, has been ""fully valued"". Through hundreds - literally - of years, society has adopted an inherent &amp; ""stable"" value in gold that, adjusting for inflation and *some other factors I will go into*, should neither appreciate nor depreciate much. In other words...absent these factors, the expected return on gold is 0% real.

But but, gold has routinely had bull markets where it doubles in value, or bear markets where the value drops in half...and generally this does not track inflation. How can this be ""stable""? The unfortunate truth for gold holders is that gold's short-term movements are much more tied down to several factors it has been pinned against.

**Real rates**

Since the US government started offering inflation-adjusted bonds, gold has had a competing asset denominated in the reserve currency that in years past offered greater than 0% real returns. **US TIPS**: bonds that are guaranteed to return some rate of return equal to inflation as measured by CPI-U, plus a fixed ""real rate"". Guaranteed by the nation with 10+ aircraft carriers, rule of law, and the strongest economy in the world. Notwithstanding flaws in CPI-U, it goes without saying that a rise in the fixed rate of TIPS makes gold less appealing, whereas a decrease in the TIPS fixed rate makes gold more appealing. This matters a big deal in how much institutional investors value gold.

Consider the scenario where you own:

* A 30-year TIPS bond worth $1000 paying a 0% real return over 30 years.
* $1000 worth of gold...implied 0% real return over...well gold lasts forever...but let's say 30 years is a reasonable investor lifetime.

Now let's suppose real rates go up 1% the day after you purchased your assets. Oof, consider the opportunity cost you just ate...had you only waited one more day you could have had bought TIPS yielding an extra 1% real over 30 years. In actuality if you try to resell your TIPS on the secondary market, **you're going to end up selling it at a loss of \~30%.** And what about gold? All other factors equal, gold is also likely going to drop in value. Maybe even by more than 30%! All this can work in the reverse direction if real rates drop.

**Foreign exchange rates**

A second factor to consider is that the world does not entirely revolve around USD. Gold is just another currency. In the last 10 years, the USD has strengthened \~20% against a comparable basket of other world currencies (as measured by the DXY index). USD has been extremely resilient in the last year in particular. If you're an investor in India or Europe, you've probably been happy with your gold investment, whereas an American is seeing it fail to keep up with inflation. The reason is a strong US dollar is a headwind to dollar-denominated gold.

In a world with no change in exchange rates - and no change in real rates - gold is expected to match inflation, but that's not the world we live in. Gold investors need to understand macro conditions are going to give way to major price fluctuations.

**What about crypto?**

Crypto is a completely different beast. As an **emerging currency**, society is still in the process of determining how much it is worth. The appreciation of BTC or ETH over the last few years has almost nothing to do with inflation, but instead almost entirely explained by fluctuations in coin adoption. As these are still emerging currencies, their stable value could be much more than where they currently are valued. It's important to note BTC and ETH are not yet stable currencies. Stabilization takes years, and generally only after they have been accepted geopolitically. In the case of gold it took hundreds of years alongside a history of government regulation and central bank ownership. The major risk of holding crypto are of geopolitical or technological nature. Consider the risk of major governments outlawing crypto, or a NewCoin emerging that steals adoption from other crypto currencies.

Million dollar question, how much could crypto be worth? And is there any risk it de-monetizes gold? Needless to say, I believe the current market cap of precious metals and crypto are so tiny compared to the rest of invest-able assets that there's minimal risk of any ""demonetization"" in either direction. Classic currencies are...well...let's call them classic. To use an analogy, rock music did not ""de-musicize"" Beethoven. To add to that, there's enough room for multiple crypto currencies.

Here's my take, and why the total asset market matters. **Why do people invest?** To trade liquidity and/or risk to grow (or maintain) wealth**.** Stock and bond markets were originally designed to allocate capital from someone that has cash to someone that needs it. **The stock market was never designed to be a store of value for the retirement savings of the entire world**. Yet, Americans in particular have universally agreed upon putting their entire life savings in the equity and liability of the top 500 publicly owned US companies. Chinese investors have decided to do the same with real estate. The problem...there simply aren't enough houses and public corporations out there to store all this value. With valuations near-stretched, investors are sitting with enormous amounts of cash on the sidelines and looking for alternate stores of value. IMO this gives way to my thesis that crypto adoption is **primarily motivated by a lack of other invest-able assets.**

**Portfolio placement**

Please consider none of this investment advice. I'm not your financial advisor...

As already mentioned, gold is likely going to work against you - short term - if real rates are rising. An inflationary environment with a growing economy (in rate of change terms) is generally not ideal for gold. Gold excels as a safe haven during **stagflation**, characterized with rising inflation alongside stagnating growth. In earnest, this has not **sustainably** happened since the 1970s.

Crypto on the other hand is still evolving. It's difficult to derive too much from back-tests considering the newness...however recent history has shown that it responds positively to high growth/high-inflation environments - such as the recent economic recovery - but does not respond well to general ""risk off"" conditions in asset markets. Truth be told, I'd be hard-pressed to pin crypto value to macro conditions...its long term value is instead going to be adoption of the coins. 

As for whether either has a place in your portfolio, IMO this is entirely up to your financial goals and risk tolerance. For someone that can stomach the volatility and desires a stagflation hedge, a small allocation (5-10%) of gold provides some protection. Crypto is an upside-capture asset; it serves a different role in a portfolio for investors that are looking to grow wealth and willing to take the risk on an emerging currency.

I'll leave you all with this...

1) treasury announces an auction (say for 10 year note) to raise X dollars.   The Treasury sets the coupon rate for this auction, say 2.5%.

2) valid non-competitive and competitive bids accepted up to deadline.   

3) competitive bids will specify the yield desired and amount of funds they want to purchase.  this is the current yield  not the yield to maturity (not sure here).

4) Treasury will sort competitive bids by yield.   Starting with the lowest yield, accept bids until X dollars in bid money is accumulated.   the yield for the last accepted competitive bid is the yield all investors (competitive and non-competitive) will receive.  say this last winning yield is 2.273%.

Thus for this yield and coupon, one would be paying $1100 for every $1000 bond purchased.   Thus if one had an accepted bid to purchase $100k, you would receive 90-ish bonds (90-ish == 100k / 1100) with a face value of $1000 each.

The link below shows a bond price of $1100 with a par of $1000 and coupon rate of 2.5% results in a 2.273 yield.

On the recent COVID variant news and countries like Portugal imposing restriction due to rising COVID cases, I'd like to provide an update on my short thesis on oil.

To summarize, I went short on oil price via put option on oil stocks a while back: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/qxibts/the\_final\_oil\_short\_of\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/qxibts/the_final_oil_short_of_2021/)

I closed my put position on oil stocks a couple days ago after realizing 40-50% profit because (a) I've never seen that kind of profit in a couple days before and (b) the US new cases are not being accurately tested and accounted for because of the holidays (still rising but clearly not at the same rate).

But I'd like to provide some updated comments on the thesis. On Friday WTI plunged about 10-13% on the news of the new COVID variant and countries like Portugal re-imposing restriction due to rising cases. I certainly did not predict this new variant but I most certainly did predict that some restrictions will happen due to the rising number of cases. Predictably, the oil stocks tanked along with oil.

All in all Friday seems like an over-reaction but my thesis still stands that rising US cases will add more fuel to the oil price decline. The weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas will be crucial for my thesis. I am holding about 5% cash for now waiting to get back after oil stocks start bottoming. I think that US cases will start peaking around the end of December.

**Background**

One of the Redditor's performed an interesting investigation of S&amp;P 500 return evaluations based on the bond rates and their effect on CAPE ratio, as opposed to taking CAPE ratio as sole indicator of under/over-valuation  of the market. You can find the details here [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7okenk/is\_the\_market\_overvalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7okenk/is_the_market_overvalued/) of the original post, and you can find here [https://mebfaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Improving-U.S.-Stock-Return-Forecasts.pdf](https://mebfaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Improving-U.S.-Stock-Return-Forecasts.pdf) a bit more methodology background. Although the analysis the author performed is a bit simplified it is still a solid work and it picked my interest. 

I updated  the data  to include the data up to November 2021.  After updating the data and coefficients (i.e  re-running linear regressions) I found that the trend is similar,  the only thing worth noting is ever-increasing gap between S&amp;P 500 value and S&amp;P 500 ""fair"" value based on the cost of capital: 

\- based on \^IRX [https://ibb.co/bQbvs7G](https://ibb.co/bQbvs7G) 

\- based on TNX [https://ibb.co/P1V5JtQ](https://ibb.co/P1V5JtQ) 

In both cases the gap between the real and the fair value is that of the level of dot com bubble. Perhaps, that's the new reality and there are certain factors that should prohibit us from comparing the dotcom evaluation with todays evaluation. However, it's still a useful exercise to compare the data across markets and continents.

**Challenge**

I tried to do perform European analysis and got stuck and data collection part.  I found it a bit challenging to get basic metrics like CAPE ratio and the real returns of STOXX 600 (European composite of top 600 companies, i.e EU analogy of S&amp;P 500). Similarly, for Nikkei  or MOEX - the data is not as readily available as it is for the US markets. 

I was wondering if anyone in this sub has an advice in regards to where to get the latest CAPE ratio/ earnings data for non-US indices without having myself to calculate this from the index composite myself."|investing|Is The Market Overvalued + The Index Data Availability Inquiryfor the markets outside of the US|6.0|0.72|['EU']

1637962561.0|0.0|t3_r2xegl|843.0|"So today S&amp;P500 dropped about 2 point something%, ending about 3% below its ATH. Of course, the market being 3% under its ATH is nothing to write home about, but the fact that it dropped by two percentage points in a single day seemed to raise some concerns.  

So I wondered: how common is it for the market to drop by two percentage points or more in a single day, and does this tell us anything about its likely return after, say, 100 days (this is likely much shorter than the time horizon of many of us here, but longer periods would likely make the effect - if any - of the drop harder to notice)? 

So I downloaded from yahoo finance  the daily S&amp;P500 data for the 1994-2021 period and played around a little with it trying to see if any correlation could be found. 

This graph shows the percentage change from the previous day versus the percentage return after 100 days: 

[One day fluctuations](https://imgur.com/a/FzScbjp)

Not seeing much of a correlation between one-day fluctuations and 100-days returns here. Also worth noting is that the days which saw a drop of 2% or more from the previous day were uncommon but not *that* uncommon (I found 299 of them in 6998 days, that is, about one every 23 days). 

I tried anyway to try to see if I could find a correlation, just for completeness' sake, and the result is what you would expect from that graph: 

[No correlation](https://imgur.com/a/0Lt9SRt) 

If anything, it would seem that the change from the previous day might be slightly *negatively* correlated to the 100-days return - i.e., great days might lead to poorer returns after 100 days - but the correlation coefficient is so low and the standard error so high that the only reasonable conclusion is that one-day changes are of no predictive value for 100-days returns. 

But what about extremes? What if we consider only the ""bad"" days in which the market dropped by more than 2%? Here is what we get:

[Bad days](https://imgur.com/a/6Pd1kN8) 

Let us compare this with the (235 out of 6998) days in which the market rose by more than 2%: 

[Good days](https://imgur.com/a/q1Cl1eR) 

About the same mean, slightly lower standard deviation but that's too close to say anything meaningful. For completeness's sake, I also looked at the ""meh days"" in which the market did not change by more than 2% in either direction from the previous day: for those days, the average return after 100 days was by 4% - more or less in line with the others - and the standard deviation was by by 0.09 -- lower than the others, but not enough that I'd be confident making any conclusions out of this. 

In conclusion: the fact that the market dropped by more than 2% today tells us nothing meaningful about what it will do in the next 100 days. Is it possible that the market will crash soon? Sure, that is always possible; but today's drop, in itself, tells us nothing about its chances."|investing|"So the market dropped by more than 2% in a day. Can we predict anything from that?

I wanted to get folks opinions on NWN. NWN is a natural gas and water utility provider based primarily in OR and WA. P/E at today‚Äôs close is around 15, and revenue has been increasing low-single digits in recent years. 

Things I like about them include:

- I lived in OR for several years and was both a residential and business customer of theirs. I know their CS is top notch / mailed statements professional /emergency response *fast* (less than 30 mins on a Friday)
- They should be pretty COVID proof, and they have a regulated monopoly. Folks need heat and they‚Äôve been supplying since the late 1800‚Äôs.
- They advertise in their annual reports that they have one of the best maintained systems in the country.

Things I don‚Äôt like about them include:
- Being a mature utility, I‚Äôm told these trade like bonds at times, and a shift in interest rates can shift their price up (on interest decrease) or down (on interest increase). 
- The NW seems to be having more weather related issues than say the midwest or northeast. For instance, wildfires in OR have been bad in recent years. I actually evacuated my house in 2020 because of them. There‚Äôs also been droughts making wildfires more likely. Buying into NWN exposes you somewhat to these regional issues, and if it gets bad enough people move thats less customers. 
- The stock likely will never be the next apple, and I‚Äôm young/looking to grow wealth quickly and safely.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Chinese regulators have asked Didi Global Inc.‚Äôs top executives to devise a plan to delist from U.S. bourses, people familiar with the matter said, an unprecedented request that‚Äôs likely to revive fears about Beijing‚Äôs intentions for its giant tech industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;The country‚Äôs tech watchdog wants management to take the company off the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the agency responsible for data security in the country, has directed Didi to work out precise details, subject to government approval, they said.  Proposals under consideration include a straight-up privatization or a share float in Hong Kong followed by a delisting from the U.S., the people added.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the privatization proceeds, the proposal will likely be at least the $14 IPO price since a lower offer so soon after the June initial public offering could prompt lawsuits or shareholder resistance, the people said. If there is a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the IPO price would probably be a discount to the share price in the U.S., $8.11 as of Wednesday‚Äôs close.  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Didi‚Äôs biggest minority shareholder, slid more than 5% in Tokyo. Deliberations continue and it‚Äôs possible regulators will backtrack on their request, the people said. Either option would deal a severe blow to a ride-hailing giant that pulled off the largest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.‚Äôs in 2014. Representatives for Didi and the CAC didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Didi sparked the ire of Beijing when it proceeded with its New York stock offering this summer, despite regulatory requests that it ensure the security of its data before the IPO. Chinese regulators quickly launched multiple investigations into the company and have considered a range of unprecedented penalties, Bloomberg News reported in July.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs possible that the delisting would be part of a package of punishments for Didi. Beijing‚Äôs municipal government has proposed an investment in the company that would give state-run firms effective control, Bloomberg News reported in September. Such an investment could help Didi finance the repurchase of its U.S.-traded shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu, which received aggregate voting power of 58% after the company‚Äôs U.S. initial public offering. SoftBank and Uber Technologies Inc. are Didi‚Äôs biggest minority shareholders.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if Didi shifts its listing to Hong Kong, it will have to address the data security concerns that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. The company may have to give up control of its data to a third-party -- again undercutting its price tag. Read more about Didi‚Äôs brushes with Beijing regulators  
&gt;  
&gt;Regulators have weighed a delisting for Didi since the summer, after the world‚Äôs largest ride-hailing company infuriated officials by ploughing ahead with its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg News has reported. A withdrawal from U.S. bourses could stoke fears of an exodus of Chinese firms as Washington and Beijing quarrel about access to listed firms‚Äô books. On Thursday, a senior Chinese regulatory official said such delistings would be a setback for relations with the U.S., while offering broad support for Hong Kong as an alternative venue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Didi -- once feted for defeating Uber in China -- has now become a test case for a broader Chinese government effort to curb the power of internet titans. Xi Jinping‚Äôs administration, keen to promote his vision of sharing the wealth or ‚Äúcommon prosperity,‚Äù has targeted an internet sector that‚Äôs accumulated vast wealth by operating on the periphery of the law, minted an unprecedented number of billionaires and enriched local and foreign investors in the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;A state-directed privatization would be unprecedented for a private firm of Didi‚Äôs stature, affirming that the Chinese government remains bent on curtailing the power of the country‚Äôs internet firms and unlocking the data and wealth hoarded during a decade of heady expansion. It would send a chilling signal to American investors, long accustomed to investing freely in China‚Äôs largest corporations from Alibaba to Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beijing‚Äôs moves against Didi have been particularly harsh, even after a crackdown that has penalized giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Cyberspace Administration of China saw Didi‚Äôs IPO decision as a challenge to the central government‚Äôs authority, which led to the CAC, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and several other agencies initiating on-site inspections at Didi‚Äôs offices in July.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that‚Äôs traditionally operated in a legal gray zone, Bloomberg News has reported.

There are also friends who follow along with us but do not have the time to research anything and so do not provide insights.

This got us thinking, wouldn't it be convenient to just pool our money in a club and let everyone handle their specialty independently but the effects would be felt collectively. John handles all the healthcare investments, Brian the banking, Steve the tech, etc. From what I have read on investment clubs its pretty clear that those who would actually manage investments can all form a club together and we wouldn't need any sort of licensing. The question comes in with the silent members who do not research or invest themselves. If we had 4 people making the decisions and 6 whose money was in the partnership but they made no input, would this mean the 4 'managers' need licensing?

Furthermore, if we were to divide the partnership in a way that the active members received more through ownership means, would this break the rules for an investment club? Ex: Brain and Steve form an investment club and both contribute $50,000. Brain manages and makes all investment decisions so he gets a 60% interest in the LLC while Steve gets 40%. From my own understanding and research it seems this should be allowed under 'sweat equity' rules but I know investing is subject to special stipulations.

However,  one thing that \*IS\* likely to happen - is that the stock price will drop after the dividend date (thus making the above strategy useless). I'm assuming then, and correct me if I'm wrong, that the stock price will eventually recover.

1. Is this ""recovery"" then due to natural stock \*growth\* or is the recovery some sort of market mechanism specific to dividend stocks where naturally money flows back into the stock after the post-dividend drop? (I'm aware this could be a distinction without a difference)
2. If recovery for many stocks is inevitable then I'm surprised I haven't seen much discussion about investment strategies where you purchase the stock after the post-dividend drop? What am I missing?

ANSWERED: The assumption that the stock price will drop after the dividend date or that the stock price will recover is incorrect. Thanks to those who answered.

Those who have followed the overall gold price curve will probably have noticed it always reaches a certain top to than fall down again.

What is your outlook on the gold price for the coming months and next year?

Wednesday new **PCE inflation data** will be released and we all know it will be hot, but high inflation seems to just scare gold instead of bolstering it, since most seem to derive from it that the Fed will tighten more rapidly.

I think however Fed will stick to its ""inflation is transitory"" narrative and won't speed up its bond tapering, let alone raise interest rates any time soon to avoid spooking the market.

Final point.. for those who want to bring up **bitcoin**, I just want to say that bitcoin and gold are not correlated in any way. Money is not flowing from gold into bitcoin. As example, in past days BTC was also down together with gold. BTC is more related to risk-on mentality like equities than it is with gold.

So how do you see gold evolve coming months and next year and why? Thanks in advance for all good feedback on this.

""ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate corporation formed through the merger of the second incarnation of CBS Corporation and the second incarnation of Viacom on December 4, 2019[4] (which were split from the original incarnation of Viacom in 2006) and headquartered at the One Astor Plaza complex in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately 700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019""

Viacom is currently trading at just 6.46x earnings, making it one of the cheapest stocks relative to earnings in the S&amp;P500. Most stocks trading at similar ratios are either cyclicals(IE Auto manufacturers). Viacom, however, has been consistently profitable, even during economic downturns. Of course, many may express concern that with the downfall of Cable, ViacomCBS may end up like Blockbuster.

Fortunately, ViacomCBS's execs are aware of this risk, and have diversified into streaming services. [ViacomCBS has seen significant growth in subscriber numbers on their streaming platforms over the past year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1047393/cbs-all-access-subscribers-us/)

Viacom has a tremendous amount of intellectual property in the shows and movies it owns. Its pivot into streaming services enables it to continue to leverage its vast content to produce earnings.

With its rapid growth with streaming, the stock is extremely cheap compared to competitors such as Disney and Netflix.

**Why is the stock so cheap?**

1. Their balance sheet shows a significant amount of liabilities. These liabilities present a risk if the company's revenue continues to decline.[Fortunately, ViacomCBS has been using their earnings to redeem senior notes to address this risk](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210226005656/en/ViacomCBS-Announces-Redemption-of-Approximately-2.0-Billion-of-Senior-Notes). As interest expenses decrease from paying off debt, this should enable them to grow earnings without needing to grow revenue.

2. Investors are scared the stock will go down. ViacomCBS' stock price is down 45% over the past 5 years. When compared to the S&amp;P doubling during that time frame, it feels like a bad stock to own. Currently, investors are piling in to big winners such as Nvidia, Tesla, etc. Solid companies at great prices just aren't on investors radar right now.

Just because the stock is down does not mean the company is doing worse, though. Viacom's Earnings Per Share is higher now than it was 5 years ago, yet the price is down nearly 50%. The stock went from a P/E of 15 to about 6-7 over the past 5 years. In other words, investors are paying substantially less for the same earnings.

3.The fallout of Archegos Capital management earlier this year resulted in a lot of shares hitting the market very quickly.

What's worth considering is with any value play, it can take a very long time before the market corrects itself. Don't buy in expecting to make a quick buck. The stock can absolutely still go down even on good news if investors fear the stock.

Other than the dividend yielding about 2.9%, it is likely ViacomCBS will use their earnings for both paying down debt, and investing in streaming.

In this video, we will take a look at five of them, HUYA, DOYU, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. We will first look at earnings before checking the latest news and possibly price movements.

# Baidu ($BIDU)

Let's start with Baidu. For the tenth consecutive quarter, Baidu beat analyst earnings expectations with an EPS of $2.3 US dollars which was $0.29 dollars or 14.4% above expectations. However, Baidu's earnings were lower than last quarter and 25.5% lower compared to the same period last year. Plus, the GAAP EPS was minus $7.48, which is a big, big loss.  That's not great for the share price because price follows earnings as Peter Lynch likes to say. Even though Baidu's revenue was in line with expectations at exactly $5.00 billion US dollars, this is their higher quarterly revenue ever with a 4% increase compared to last quarter and 16.7% increase compared to last year! That was driven by Baidu's AI cloud which grew by 73% compared to last year! Cloud is massively growing in China with Baidu and Alibaba being two of the main players in the country so let's take a look at Alibaba.

# Alibaba ($BABA)

Alibaba posted one of its worst earnings releases ever! Alibaba failed to meet earnings expectations with an EPS of only $1.75, missing analyst expectations by $0.19 US dollars or 9.7%! This is a 31.9% drop from last quarter and 35.6% drop from last year which is really concerning. On top of it all, Alibaba missed revenue expectations with only $31.4 billion dollars. It is still 33.8% higher than the same period last year, but the revenue came 2% under analyst expectations. Out of the last 3 earnings reports, Alibaba has failed to meet earnings and revenue expectations twice, which is a very, very concerning sign for a growing company. Even worse, Alibaba reduced their revenue guidance for the current fiscal year which is typically not a good look and it's even worse when combined with both an earnings and revenue miss.

# Tencent ($TCEHY or $0700.HK)

Then, we've got Tencent. Unfortunately, Tencent missed both earnings and revenue analyst expectations for the latest quarter just like Alibaba. Tencent reported an EPS of $0.51 dollars, which is what they also reported last year. In terms of revenue, Tencent reported $22.28 billion US dollars which is 2% under expectations although it still shows a 17.5% increase as compared to last year. Tencent's biggest segment, gaming, is doing well, increasing by 28% as compared to last year if we take out changes in currency. Tencent's second biggest segment, FinTech and Business services, also grew by 30% which was good to see. Overall, Tencent is posting a decent revenue growth, but its profits are lagging behind.

# HUYA ($HUYA)

The next company is HUYA who released their earnings on the 9th of November. HUYA reported an EPS of $0.12 US dollars which was $0.06 US dollars above analyst expectations, basically double of what they expected. That looks good, but we need to remember that analysts massively reduced expectations in the month leading up to the earnings release. Plus, HUYA had an EPS of $0.23 US dollars for the same quarter last year and an EPS of $0.16 for last quarter so we can see that HUYA's earnings are trending down. On the upside, HUYA reported a revenue of $465.5 million US dollars, which was 2% under analyst expectations, but it was still 10% higher than last year and 2% higher than last quarter's so there's a steady improvement there. Their paying users for HUYA Live remain the same number as last year so no changes there even though their total mobile users went up by 15%.

# Douyu ($DOYU)

Now, let's take a look at DOYU which are essentially HUYA's main competitor even though both companies have Tencent as their majority owner. Just like HUYA, DOYU beat the analyst earnings expectations by $0.01 US dollars with an EPS of minus $0.03 US dollars, but, again, the expectations were lowered going up to the earnings so an earnings beat doesn't mean much. Their EPS for the same period last year was $0.06 so there's a big drop there although the current EPS is slightly better than the previous quarter. In terms of revenue, DOYU missed expectations like HUYA by just under 1%, which is pretty much in-line really. However, DOYU's revenue has dropped over 5% from the same period last year, which is not good. Also, their paying users have dropped by 10% year-on-year to just 7.2 million in the latest quarter.

# Trend, news and outlook

So, the overall trend here is a slowing revenue growth and slowing earnings. We can see that in the results and we can see it in the guidance. So, why is this happening? There are several reasons behind this. First of all, the Chinese economy has been slowing over the last quarter which has concerned a lot of investors. Inflation is also going up worldwide along with shipping costs. Then, we have still not seen the fallout from Evergrande's collapse in China and that is worrying. Evergrande has the potential to inflict a massive hit to the global stock market. We also have the new regulations around data security, data privacy, gaming, tech companies overall. We've seen Alibaba and Baidu taking a revenue and earnings hit. We have seen Alibaba getting the massive fine. In addition to all that, DOYU's CEO has also just reported that Chinese regulators have suspended the approval of new games in China to tackle the perceived video game addiction by Chinese youth. This will cut into the earnings of the gaming industry in which DOYU, HUYA and Tencent are involved.

Basically, the next 3 to 6 months look a bit bleak right now although some analysts argue that this is setting up China for steady growth after an initial slowdown. Personally, I'm currently bearish on China. We've seen the latest price action for HUYA, DOYU, Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent. We had a few false breakouts, but in the end the prices dropped again. All five companies currently trade at a massive discount. HUYA and DOYU are trading at their all-time lows! Alibaba is trading at a PE of 17.5 compared to its historical average of 27 to 30. When's the last time that Tencent has traded at a PE of 21? Over 5 years ago, maybe more. All of these look like amazing bargains right now, but are they? I read a detailed interview with Stanley Druckenmiller years ago and he said something along the lines of ""Don't look at the fundamentals, look at what's moving the price"". With DOYU, HUYA, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent there's been two main things moving the price. Regulation is the big one, but there's also the slowdown in revenue and earnings. This tells me two things.

First of all, investors wants to see reassurance that China will not destroy its tech companies. There is a decent chance that China will want to exercise more control over its tech companies, maybe even place members of the CCP on the board like it did with Bytedance, the company behind TikTok. Do you know what would happen if they do that? These companies will be delisted from US stock exchanges. Just think of all the institutions and hedge funds that would have to exit. Share prices will plummet. I'm not saying that it will happen, but there is a small chance. Plus, the Chinese government has outlined a 10-year plan that includes strict regulation of big tech companies. A ten year plan. I wouldn't hold my breath for any good news in terms of regulation there over the next year.

Second of all, investors want to see better earnings. However, again, we need to see signs that earnings will be improving and this will not happen for at least 3 months ahead, most likely for longer if the slowdown in Chinese economy continues.

# Summary and personal thoughts

The way I see it, buying these companies is a bet on the actions of the Chinese government. Personally, I think this is extremely risky. I have less than 2% of my total portfolio in these companies and my plan is to continue adding a bit every month in case I turn out to be wrong, but keeping my overall exposure to about 2.5%. However, I know that a lot of retail investors are bullish on these companies. There are good reasons behind it, but I think it's extremely important to consider the risk here and manage the exposure. As Peter Lynch likes to say, be careful when thinking that a company cannot go lower because it can and often it will. DOYU, HUYA, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent can very well turn out to be value traps for the next year. We still haven't seen any signs that the bearish trend in their prices has been reverted. If you want to buy the dip, that's fine, but just be careful and manage your exposure. I'm not a financial advisor and you can make up your own mind, but just do your research and think about the risk. I don't think we will see a big rise in price until we see a catalyst and I think there are stocks, even indexes, that can offer better returns over the next 12 months.

Overall, I'm neutral, given China's recent regulation record plus the slowing revenue and earnings growth seen. However, I also think that the market is punishing those companies way too much so I think they're actually trading at a decent discount, which is why I continue to build a position even though it's a smallish one.

I commented that they should post this here and they gave me permission to do so.  I have seen this paper referenced a number of times on this sub so I'm curious to hear peoples' thoughts on this rebuttal.  I have no personal bias one way or the other, just curiosity.


You may have seen this paper (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701) floating around various investment subreddits over the past week. It usually comes with the title How to 3x the S&amp;P CAGR with less risk | Leverage for the Long Run with people praising it as an amazing new strategy that requires little effort, provides a high degree of safety, and allows you to experience only the good side of leveraged ETFs. Here's why it's complete bullshit.

I've seen the 200 SMA argument posted hundreds of times before in r/LETFs. I'm glad this one at least comes with a paper, but the paper is still falling for the same mistakes other believers fall for. The author is correct that volatility increases below any significant moving average (20/50/100/200), however, avoiding volatility should not be your main concern when holding unhedged leveraged ETFs. Your main concern should be flash crashes like in 1987 where the market fell 22% in one day. The author says this:

Chart 6 shows that historically, the worst 1% of trading days have occurred far more often than not below the Moving Average. Included in this list are the two worst days in market history: October 19th in 1987 and October 28th in 1929

Wow look at that, moving averages helped avoid the worst two days... but why? The answer is partially due to the fact that both the best and worst days will be in periods of high volatility, but it's also heavily influenced by pure chance. A day like Black Monday could happen at anytime and if there wasn't a choppy market leading up to it you will miss it with moving averages. An unleveraged 22% drop would be a 66% drop for the portfolio suggested in the paper. The market would then likely dip below the 200 SMA and the person would sell! Missing the entire ride back up, even if there was more to fall you're not going to be left in a good place.

There is no macroeconomic reason that moving averages have any form of predictive power. The closest thing would be the concept of a self fulfilling prophecy which would require a massive audience of believers to have an impact (there are not nearly enough). People always use 200 SMA, but if you try to test other SMAs nearby you sometimes get significantly worse results. The 200 SMA just happens to get you out before the Dot Com crash as well as the GFC. When your entire reasoning is based on well it did good in the past you're overfitting by definition.

Let's look at another strategy that has an economic backing - HFEA. Holding stocks and bonds together isn't something that just happens to work when you test it. When stocks experience uncertainty large investors move their money into the safety of bonds which forces them in the opposite direction to the stock. Stocks and bonds are slightly, but not perfectly inversely correlated and both of them have positive expected returns. This is why they are the ideal hedge.

I also want to point out that this is not an academic paper that came from a university. It was published by https://www.leadlagreport.com/ which says on its homepage ""Consistently win in the stock market and minimize risk regardless of market conditions"" followed by a subscribe button.

For quite a while I have been thinking that despite governments not doing real politics regarding climate change because priorities will always be towards growth, I think that eventually governments will have no option and do real politics about the rising damages and problems created by climate change and pollution.

Mining is one of the most polluting activity and geological destruction of biodiversity. Yet, today society and its technologies and economic growth demands are always demanding more minerals.

I am guessing that eventually governmental policies will enforce that recycled minerals be prioritized over mining, just as we see now more and more big chains of fashion industries marketing more and more of their clothes from recycled wool.

Thinking about it, I have invested in Befesa (steel and aluminium recycling) and EcoGraf (graphite recycling for batteries).

1637639060.0|0.0|t3_r0419z|43.0|" While many traditional investors understand and agree with the philosophy of crypto, they are afraid to own it due to the implied volatility and unfamiliarity of the asset class. However, stablecoins pose to be a solution to this problem, and it may just be the Trojan Horse needed to introduce non-believers to the crypto rabbit-hole.

So what exactly are stablecoins?

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a specific asset class, such as commodities or fiat currencies. This allows investors to jump into the world of crypto without having to worry about depreciation or the volatility generally associated with the crypto asset class.

However, just because the price remains stable doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are risk-free. In fact, investors need to fully understand the underlying asset risk behind stablecoins before investing in one. There are primarily 4 types of stablecoins:

1. Fiat-backed stablecoins: Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currency such as the U.S Dollar, and are relatively steadier than the others due to this correlation. However, the downside is that these currencies are not truly decentralized, since the underlying asset is linked to a centralized institution such as the Central Bank. A great example of a fiat-backed stablecoin is USDC or U.S Dollar Coin by Coinbase.
2. Crypto-backed stablecoins: crypto-backed stablecoins use cryptocurrencies as collateral in order to keep the price stable. In most cases, these will be overcollateralized, meaning that there will be an over-allocation of the underlying crypto asset to deal with any selling pressure. The main risk here is that if the underlying assets drop enough, then these stablecoins will ultimately lose their value. So as an investor in crypto-backed stablecoins, it may be a good idea to also keep an eye on how the underlying asset is doing. An example of a crypto-backed stablecoin is DAI, which uses ETH as the underlying crypto asset.
3. Precious-metal stablecoins: Precious-metal stablecoins use commodities such as gold as the underlying asset for the crypto token. The price doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to remain stable for these tokens and can instead track the underlying commodity in a 1:1 ratio. In a way, they can act almost as ETFs for the commodity, allowing investors to gain access to a financial asset such as gold without having to take on the burden of storing it. Digix is an example of a stablecoin that tracks the price of gold.
4. Algorithmic stablecoins: Algorithmic stablecoins use algorithms in order to bring stability to prices. Many coins will use algorithms that increase or decrease supply based on the demand in order to accomplish this. Some examples of algorithmic stablecoins are AMPL and FEI.

So why do we need stablecoins?

Stablecoins provide an entry point for traditional investors who are interested in dabbling with crypto. Since there is a familiar underlying asset behind these coins, traditional investors can feel relatively more comfortable buying them when compared to something new such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The volatility, or lack thereof, is also attractive for a lot of investors who just want to get started with crypto and earn some yield by holding or lending their money.

Beyond that, stablecoins also provide functionalities such as fast transfers that don‚Äôt require financial service fees or traditional banking applications. Centralized stablecoins can also be thought of as simple digital forms of fiat currency that don‚Äôt require a bank account to store. For individuals who want to be truly bankless, stablecoins are the perfect solution."|investing|Why stablecoins are the gateways drugs of crypto investing|43.0|0.62|['AMPL', 'Bitcoin or Ethereum', 'the U.S Dollar', 'ETH', 'the Central Bank', 'USDC', 'Fiat', 'FEI', 'U.S Dollar Coin', 'DAI']

I have control of the portfolio and invest however I'd think is best (of course with help when needed), basically like a hedge fund but I saw that only those with 1 million in assets or 200k in income can invest in hedge funds, and mutual funds in general are big enough to only charge 1-2% a year and they only have a 30% allowable leverage, I'm wondering if there's a middle ground where I can receive investments from the average person, use their money and leverage it like a hedge fund, and trade stocks more aggressively to aim for a higher return

For those of your wondering what the hell to do now, I introduce you to a new unsung hero Michael Gayed. Michael has found a way to systemically outperform the S&amp;P 500 by over 3x while taking on less risk and it's an extremely simple investment strategy.

Everyone says that triple leveraged ETFs have volatility decay and are not meant for long-term holding. Well guess what, those people are idiots. Let's look at the data: If you invested in UPRO using this guy's simple strategy, backtested all the way back to 1928, you would have returned 27% CAGR while the S&amp;P did 9% and by taking on half as much risk (0.6 Sharpe ratio for this strategy vs. 0.3 for buy &amp; hold.

The rules are simple, if the underlying index closes below the 200 day moving average, you sell. Once it crosses back above the 200 MA, then reenter. That is it. **Investing $10k in 1928 with this strategy would have returned $28 TRILLION (with a T) while the S&amp;P would have returned $39 million.**

The reason this works is because of the lack of volatility above the 200 MA, and higher volatility below the 200 MA.

Enjoy the sweet taste of compounding returns my friends because this is a ticket to an early retirement.

I don't understand how people can exist with a trader mindset. It's seems like you need to study alot of quasi science, be on social media constantly, do alot of cocaine, and it really just seems stressful. 

The neat thing about reddit is I can look and see when people post their ""analysis"" of a stock. Which for 99% of reddit, is just a trader saying voodoo witch craft nonsense about enter and exit points, resistance this and that, cutting losses, and special orders. 

Then you ask for their portfolio and they have none or its top secret or something. It's not illegal to share your portfolio you great traders. 

I'm an average Joe, and I'm not that smart. so I feel really good when I read posts from people who buy a stock like MU, three years ago, at 40-43 a share, and sell it saying they see no future in it. It's trading at like $83 now. 

I love it when I read people saying they bought Uber near ipo at 40 and sold at 32 and say it's doomed to fail. But Uber is still around, in fact it hit a height of $60 last spring and now it's $44. You haven't even given it a chance to grow or become something yet. Like the company is a verb, give it a few years. 

I think traders are like fake friends in high school. They're only around you if you're cool. Once you're not cool anymore they abandon you. But traders are onlu a small portion of money for a company a company makes stuff to sell to people and that's what really draws in revenue to grow. 

I see alot of people talk about the ""opportunity cost"" or ""oppurtuniy lost, "" something like that when you're not trading. Like if I buy something that isn't moving fast, or something is in the red, it's better to ""cut my losses."" 

But that's like... Buying high and selling low. 

That sounds like the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do.

Honestly, I'd rather sink with my ship if you're telling me to always sell the moment my stock goes red. 

if I was so foolish as to pick a bad company, I'd rather just take the full loss, rather then death by a thousand cuts. 

But I pick companies that make more revenue every year, have increasing dividends, and are medium to large size growth companies. 

I'm boring. 

I just look at the best performing companies, read their 10k and just invest. My first two companies I bought were Apple and Starbucks, I then bought Nvidia and Realty Income. I bought Pennymac and Weyerhaeuser afterward. I just sorta sit on them. I just hold them and buy more. If I somehow become broke instantly from these decisions then damn. 

I'm investing in known companies with easy business models. I like safety and simplicity. 

I don't believe I'm gonna become a multi millionaire with several cars and boats. I just want to make enough money to be the first millionaire in my family, and have my children live of my dividends so they don't have to work so hard.

I am a very average investor with give or take about $600 to use on both new projects I like and DCA into promising ones I hold. The trouble is, there are so many amazing projects out there that it is a struggle to shrug a lot of them off, so I keep adding new tokens to my portfolio, which then makes the choice of what to DCA into incredibly hard, because I start to believe I am spreading the love way to thin on the projects I hold due to my limited funds.

I then find myself getting tempted to get out of projects just so I can DCA more ''meaningful'' amounts into others every month. I am in some blue chip projects like ETH and DOT, but it almost feels silly (I know it's not really but it's just so small it feels negligible to me) putting $60 in ETH monthly because I have 9 other projects to add to.

Is it best to reduce the number of projects I am in so I can allocate more cash to each one, or keep them all and keep topping up with these tiny amounts I can afford every month?"|investing|My ONLY issue with DCA (Crypto related post)|0.0|0.37|['ETH', 'DOT']

El Salvador, the only country in which bitcoin is a legal tender, is going to build an entire city based on the largest cryptocurrency, President Nayib Bukele said in a Saturday night presentation at Bitcoin Week in El Salvador.

‚ÄúBitcoin City‚Äù will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. The government plans on locating a power plant by the volcano to provide energy for both the city and bitcoin mining, the president said.

According to Bukele, Bitcoin City will be a full-fledged metropolis with residential and commercial areas, restaurants, an airport as well as a port and rail service. The city will be laid out in a circle (like a coin) and in the city center will be a plaza that will be host to a huge bitcoin symbol. The city will have no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes.

Bukele also said El Salvador plans on issuing $1 billion US ‚Äúbitcoin bond,‚Äù a tokenized financial instrument developed by Blockstream, on the Liquid Network. Of that amount, $500 million will be used to help construct needed energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure and $500 million to buy even more bitcoin. At the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent trading price of about $59,000, that would bring the country‚Äôs treasury stash to just under 2,000 bitcoins.

Taking a peek at PIMIX it seems like it has performed very well, but is this really just because of the bond bull market (falling rates)? It would seem a bit crazy to expect continued 7-8% yearly returns. SEC yield is currently not even 2.5%.

I would be holding this partly as a bond allocation in a quarterly rebalanced tax-advantaged account ( most likely ) but also as a cash alternative.

The other downside I can see right up front seems to be the $25k minimum, which makes it not possible to use in a small IRA or 401k as a bond allocation of say 20%, since you'd need $100k+ in that account before that would be a 20% allocation."|investing|Thoughts on PIMIX and other actively managed bond funds?|3.0|0.58|[]

They are not mine either, but I came across this stock just kind of goofing around and now I‚Äôm seriously considering buying it. I trust this sub more than any other community on the internet when it comes to good DD and analysis, so please forgive me for posting about a relatively unknown company.

I was screening for stocks in the restaurant sector that met my criteria for the industry (low PE, good margins, growing revenue and EPS, etc) when I came across GTIM, a company I‚Äôd never heard of before.

The first thing that caught my eye was the extremely low PE at less than 4. I assumed that the companies growth must be non existent and/or they had a terrible debt/cash ratio. I was completely wrong. 

GTIM‚Äôs revenue grew 40% this quarter to 34,000,000 dollars. Their net income grew 4500 percent (no, that‚Äôs not a typo) this quarter to 13.6 million dollars. They have 10,000,000 in cash on hand and paid off all of their debt. 

The companies restaurants have great reviews at all 35 locations (based in Colorado and Wyoming) and are diversified in the types of restaurants they operate (some sit down, some drive thru).

On the most recent earnings call (AUG 10th) the CEO said they plan on opening one new location in 2022 and only using cash to finance this restaurant as well as any restaurants GTIM opens in the future. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this, but it certainly provides a margin of safety that most low market cap stocks don‚Äôt have to offer.

I usually stick to value or GARP investing but I feel like this might be too great of a buy to ignore. The only negative I could find was the extremely low average volume (30,000). Can someone tell me if I‚Äôm missing something here? I‚Äôm planning on researching the company further and potentially investing, but wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss anything before I dove in deeper."|investing|Am I missing something with $GTIM?|2.0|0.55|['EPS', 'GARP', 'PE']

His perspective is that a large percentage of investors just buy SPY or similar ETFs. Such a sizable amount that the diversity argument for them is effected. Diversity only works well if there's enough buyers and sellers of the individual stocks that make up the index. But if mostly everyone is buying the index, diversity doesn't matter: as instead of the index ""tracking"" these stocks the index is influencing their price instead; thus you start to have similar liquidity issues as you would it you only bought stock in one or two companies. 

In other words, the more people invest in index funds, the less effective the diversity of the index fund is, and the more liquidity risk you are exposed to. Basically it's better to handle diversification more actively rather than rely on indexes.

When I was a kid we lived under hyperinflation which is a complete shit show, people get their paychecks and immediately go buy their groceries for the month.

Long story short, my bar is a bit out of place here... so should I be concerned with the 6.2% rate? My take on this: likely FED will increase rates, which will devalue bonds and stock prices.

Take a look at the post content and you'll see a pattern that will repeat: one or two paragraphs of content-free 'analysis' about events in whatever mining sector, then a series of 'pitch' paragraphs where they link to a random junior miner and include the ticker.

If you check out my history, you'll know that I went long on oil stocks and sold out most of my position a while back (OXY, OVV, HP). I lucked out on HP as I sold it the day before earnings, which resulted in a 14% correction as HP is still incurring massive loss.

The reason I sold were twofold: (1) oil made a massive rally from September to October, so profit taking is warranted; (2) UK and EU covid cases were and still are trending up, and the bigger point is that the US chart is showing the same direction.

On this COVID cases situation, once new cases start rising, it will not stop going up for 2-4 weeks when new cases plateu and then start trending down. If you check back this year, new COVID cases and oil price follow an almost perfect reverse graphs. Easy to understand: more lockdown means less energy needed.

So just holding cash is not good enough for me. I feel that the market still has not fully priced in this final oil price correction. As such, I bought puts on some of the same oil companies I went long previously that have the most exposure to oil spot price. I avoid the ones with the most pristine balance sheet (OVV) in favor of the one with the most troublesome debt burden (OXY). Experience watching these stocks tell me that OXY has a lot more room to fall in the case of an oil price slump than those with better earnings.

I predict that this will be the final wave of COVID as far as the world is concerned. After this, society will be too jaded and fatigue to do any serious curtailment or lockdown.

\--------------------------------

A new easing regulations were implemented in 2012 for Foreigners owning property in Turkey.

The Release of Real Estate Ownership Law for Foreigners in Turkey

The Turkish government has made significant amendments to the Turkish Real Estate Law regarding the conditions that must be met by foreign individuals wishing to own real estate in Turkey by approving the law number 6302 on 05.05.2012, where they lifted some restrictions on the ownership of foreigners. ¬†¬†And provided some facilities in the conditions to be met by foreign individuals wishing to own real estate in Turkey, with restrictions imposed on citizens of some neighboring countries of Turkey.

The Flexibility of the Ownership Law for Foreigners in Turkey

With this law, Turkey has given the right of property ownership to citizens of 183 countries without being subject to reciprocity. The most important reason for issuing this law, which opened the way for foreign investors to own real estate in Turkey, is to increase the desire of investors to invest in the real estate sector. The most important part of this law is canceling the reciprocity conditions for foreign investors. Thus, individuals from foreign countries are able to buy a property in Turkey, although Turks are not allowed to own the property in those countries to which those individuals belong. The principle of reciprocity is the rights and privileges granted by one State to the nationals of the other State, and the same privileges and rights are accorded to the nationals of those States.

 Which Nationalities are Entitled to Own an Unconditional Property in Turkey?

Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, Yemen, Oman, Sudan, Germany, America, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Djibouti, Chad, Jake, Finland, France, South Africa, South Sudan, Georgia, Netherlands, Honduras, Britain, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Kosovo, Costa Rica, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Norway, Panama, Suriname, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Venezuela and New Zealand."|investing|Is it a good time to Invest in Turkey ?|0.0|0.36|['Nationalities', 'Property/Business/Land in Turkey', 'the Turkish Real Estate Law', 'State']

One way of valuing the true value of a stock is how much in earnings it will produce in the future. Present earnings are worth more than future earnings. Generally, a discount rate is used, which is based on treasury yields, but at a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk of owning equities.

Historically, the S&amp;P 500 earnings yield has often closely tracked the 10 year treasury yield, because earnings are expected to grow over time, providing further upside potential, whereas treasuries pay a fixed rate.

https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf

This hasn't been the case in current years. Currently, the S&amp;P500's forward earnings yield is 4.68%, vs a 1.53% treasury yield.

Contrast this with the '99 tech bubble, where treasury yields were much higher than the S&amp;P500 earnings yield prior to the crash.

The big risk is of course rising treasury yields as the fed tapers, and eventually raises benchmark rates. Rising treasury yields make bonds more attractive relative to current equity prices, which can lead to a decline if earnings aren't growing.

Fortunately, there is a way you can hedge against this risk. During periods of rising interest rates and inflation, ""Value"" stocks usually outperform ""growth"" stocks. This is because earnings are discounted based on current interest rates. 

Because interest rates are at historical lows, companies like Tesla, Roblox, Rivian, Lucid Motors are valued at extremely high valuations. This is because when you use a discount rate of 1-2%,  future earnings are worth very close to present earnings.

With a discount rate of 2%, earnings in 30 years are worth 55% of present earnings. However, if you raise that discount rate to 7% due to higher treasury yields, earnings 30 years from now are worth just 11% of present earnings!

On the contrary, value stocks like Intel are currently very cheap. In this market, no one wants to own ""Dinosaur"" companies that aren't growing. They would rather own the companies they expect to be bigger in 30 years, like AMD, Nvidia, etc. And with a 1-2% discount rate, the math checks out. 

When interest rates rise substantially, if they do, growth stocks that depend on low rates to justify their valuation will get hit HARD, with as much as 80% downside. Value stocks will be hit as well as their future earnings are discounted further, but not nearly to the same extent that growth stocks do, since they have high present earnings.

Personally, my portfolio is tilted very high towards value stocks and profitable stocks. I hold Fidelity Large Cap Value and Fidelity Small Cap value, and Fidelity Real Estate, as well as VYM and VIG as an indirect way to factor tilt towards profitable stocks.

Of course, stocks always carry market risk. A recession can drive a crash due to lower earnings, as it did in 2009, and in 2020. If you are investing for the short term, it may be smart to avoid having too much in equities."|investing|Rather than comparing P/E to History, Compare Earnings Yields to Treasury Yields|97.0|0.87|['VIG', 'AMD', 'Fidelity Small Cap', 'Fidelity Large Cap Value', 'Intel', 'Fidelity Real Estate', 'VYM']

1. Do I need to buy 100 stocks on 1 price for example if xyz stock is at 1 dollar, I need 100 of them to place a covered call? Because of FIFO? I have 100 but each priced and dated at different value (97 98 99).






2. If the strike price is 1 and the person exercise his right for whatever reason at 0.99, you lose your 100 shares because he bought them?






3. Why is there an option strike price lower than your bought share or currently at, if you bought 100 shares at 1 dollar, there's a covered call for 0.50, if you did this, would it be sold? Isn't that a put? 





4. When the contract is about to expire, do you need to care if it expires rather it is in the money or not? For example, it's at 1.01 and your strike price is 1 and the person lets say forgot about it and it expires, are they automatically sold since it reached the price at expire? 





5. Any stocks are best to do covered calls on? That isn't expensive, just want to try on low cost for now, and which type of stock do you look for that seems promising, so far I know the more volumes the better!

Originally a small company with roots in the San Diego area, SIRC now operates in about 40 states after acquiring several subsidiaries at a rapid pace over the past 12 months. These acquisitions include Enerev, a solar sales company; Plemco, an electric vehicle charging company that bids for government contracts and has recently entered the residential space; Cornerstone Construction, a successful multi-state roofing company with ties to the broader roofing and contractor industry SIRC is aiming to synergize with at the national level; Future Home Power, a door-to-door solar sales company headed by Jason Newby, the all-time leading salesperson at Vivant; Balance Claims, which will handle all back-office matters for SIRC; and USA Solar Networks, a solar sales network operating in dozens of states, headed by solar industry veteran Pablo Diaz. The CEO of SIRC is David Massey.

Some of the main business activities of SIRC include: selling solar projects to residential and commercial customers; installing solar projects; supplying solar panels to other companies, such as Solectrac and Healixa; and installing electric vehicle charging stations.

SIRC posted revenue of about $10 million for the quarter ending August 31, 2021, up from about $5 million a year earlier. The company has been expressing expectations of earning over $20 million during the summer months (quarter three), with the hope of achieving $100 million annual revenue in 2022. In addition to looking forward to the numbers for quarters three and four, we as investors are optimistic that even higher revenues are possible over time given the tailwinds, governmental and cultural, lining up behind green energy, and the recent track record of expansion SIRC's team has laid down.

Still trading on the OTC Pinks, SIRC recently completed an audit of its subsidiaries acquired through early 2021, which will allow them to apply for uplisting to the OTCQB exchange in the near future. The company's stated goal is to eventually uplist to the Nasdaq.

The outstanding common shares of SIRC are 430,000,000, with 500,000,000 total authorized. Shares have been used to fund the acquisitions the company was making in 2020 and especially 2021. Management has communicated that new share issuances should be kept to a minimum going forward, and that the focus now is on creating cohesion and growth among the various subsidiaries. Another stated goal, profitability, was informally announced as having been achieved in September 2021. Arbiter Bank recently invested $42 million in SIRC, which we think speaks to the investability of the company. Dutchess Capital, an advising firm for smaller publicly traded companies that are expanding and looking to uplist, has taken SIRC on as a client.

SIRC's share price has been volatile over the past year. After trading under $.10 for most of 2020, the price began to rise at year's end and catapulted up to $3.00 in short order in February 2021. It declined consistently after that, ultimately to about $.30, but has jumped back up to around $.50, which has served as a rough support zone throughout much of this year. Polaris Small Cap Research recently released a report with price targets for SIRC ranging from $1.50 to $3.00.

Concerns regarding SIRC may include: low-penny debt notes held by early investors with an interest in profit-taking; past delays in the audit and uplisting process; the competition and evolving climate in the solar and EV industries.

It's worthy to note that SIRC will be changing their name to better fit the company as they are far from only doing Solar roof installs now, there is a poll in the discord as to what the name should be.

Why I am attracted to this stock can be found in my previous post here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/qsewj2/sirc\_solar\_and\_ev\_charging\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/qsewj2/sirc_solar_and_ev_charging_play/)

To summarize that post its Arbiter Capital $42m investment, Mohave farms Solar field ($150m over 30 years revenue ) , EV charging, Up-listing, Revenue growth and profitability in the near future.

It‚Äôs the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.

It‚Äôs easy to dismiss Rivian‚Äôs performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week‚Äôs analysis, let‚Äôs deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it‚Äôs the right time to invest in the company \[1\].

**The Company**

Rivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)

 It was only in Dec‚Äô17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV. The company aims to have a vertically integrated structure with a vast majority of R&amp;D occurring in-house.  

The idea is to not only sell the vehicles but upsell and also create recurring revenues from each sale. Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services.

**Products**  

Rivian‚Äôs product line is very straightforward as of now. They have two products (R1T and R1S) that are aimed at the general public and they are also in a partnership with Amazon to create custom delivery vehicles.

The reviews for the pickup truck R1T have been nothing short of phenomenal (that too from hardcore enthusiasts).

&gt;R1T is unlike any pickup we've ever driven‚Äîpart truck, part sport sedan, and 100 percent amazing - [Motortrend](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcGOhCAQRL9muGkAEWYOHPayv2EQWoeo6EI7xv367RlvSwhNSFWq8vAOYVzzaREKsm0t2OG5gU1wlBkQIbO9QO5isCxYbqQ3PYulGzLA4uJs2bb3c_QO45reqsYIrgV7WtO6wfBW6tAL1xoX2qaV4B4DGCX7tr3C3B4iJA8WXpDPNQGb7RNxK7fm6ya_aR_HUS8rrhkzpFD7daHHDK9IDekmuZRVjq_oUpUFVjCDxxx9tUU_7VuFefdTNcRcsAqkg-rykpVFS25BSwspePuoZa2FV-YuVBiEUlLqGn-eeOe_cFN8GUVd9r6g89O7B8t2cXkCLJAwLnTUMwWQcnyj-UiITkdz2VPEs4Pk-hmCpVLA8GL-wdiNkCDTX4TOoRW6MVwrrbnQ5uJEZJXiQknNGXUIK7nS__g_AYueHQ)  
Rivian's R1T is not just the first battery-powered light-duty pickup, it's also just a really good truck - [CNET](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkcFuwyAQRL8m3GyxhGD3wKGX_oaFYe2g2NiFdSz367tOeipCLEgzmtHDO8JxyYclLCTWpVBHx4o24V4mJMIstoK5i8GKYGWjfNOLWLohI84uTlasWz9F7ygu6VRdG5AGxN2atjUe_Q2NasF9yMH4YUCn-wbAG9m8w9wWIiaPFp-YjyWhmOydaC2X6-dFffHe9732Can2y8zPvLhQ7svO17MjDyWVqnJ8RpeqDFThhJ5y9BXlzT-qIeZCVWABVhmfEU-riJZtwMuAAnn7qFVtwOumBR0G0FopU9P3nVr5gxct5xHqsvWFnH-cRUS2s8sPpIKJ4sxHPXEAK8eTykvCYDqe85YiHR0m108YLJdCQW_cL4LdiAkzf0PoHFkw10YabYwE84eIoWotQSsjBXcIC7vS__hfRkCbtg)

But not all reviews have been positive:

&gt;Even if the R1T does prove rugged and reliable, I have yet to see any evidence that the core of America‚Äôs truck-loving customers will be taken by its altruistic promise - [Bloomberg](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUcuOwyAM_JpyI8KEJemBw172NyIeboqaQBacRt2vX7K9LbL8QGN7NPaWcM7lZQgrsS1Xmui1oUl41AWJsLC9YpliMCwYMUg_OBbrdCuIq42LYdvulugtxZxOVD-A0MDuxiPAh3QgvbrBdeyD06rVOA4OeqH1e5ndQ8Tk0eATyysnZIu5E2310n9e5Fez4zg6t-S8Oixz5_Pa_k52LdhC0S94plJI4OLK5diKEp_RJl6AeMFnxIPjgp5K9DymGdMe6cXdTjzkxJvHDVPgLY_Eb7nwI5cHi-ac2Z4GCeLj2slOg1fDCCrcQCkpdUffdxrFD16UWGfo6u4qWf84WbJiVlseSBUTxbW5bonPEzmfuv1BmnRTi-ueGqEJk3ULBkNlR0bvg_xpPDXKWNqhwmTJgO4HoZXWAvTwFrHJrpQAJbVgjUPIrSv9X_8L24emwg)

No matter the reviews, at least we can rest easy knowing that the company has a working and driving product, unlike Nikola [which just filmed a truck rolling down](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkLtuwzAMRb8mGgW9nQwaigIFunXobsgS7aixZVeiUrhfXyXeShAkh0uQ93iHMK15twgFybYW7HHfwCb4KTMgQia1QO5jsCRY1gnfDSSWfswAi4uzJVsd5ugdxjU9VLLjzHBytcGPUnInjeTGaw1nLYJ2To3BN8VFH8dcDRGSBwt3yPuagMz2iriVk3w5ibeW-1qx0gHaOOjPj_ev-Bq0J9EKJngLwwVn-kIFNdyr7sxVGLlSQhiK31c8s184KbZMnJY6FHT-Rv26kGwXl2-ABRLGpRU6x_tDOT1sPSXNWd_6UlPEvYfkhhmCxVyB4MHriaCfIEFuHEPv0HIjO2aUMYyb7vDYqCjFuBKGkfZDWNtW-n_-DwmZhLc) a hill to satisfy its investors.

Adding to the arguably great product, Rivian is building its own charging network which is expected to offer more than 3,500 fast chargers exclusively to Rivian owners (planned by 2023). Living up to the name (‚ÄòAdventure Network‚Äô) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers. 

**Investors &amp; Partnerships**

Even more than the product, I would argue that Rivian‚Äôs management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.

They have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.

One of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!

But you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is. [In the case of Nikola](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuwyAMhp8mHCMgBNiBw7SpbzBN2yUi4DSoCenAtMqefqS9zbJsyf6t3_qcRThvaTcIGcl1yzjgfgUT4Z4XQIRESoY0BG-IN1Rxp0YS8jAlgNWGxZBrGZfgLIYtHqpOMSoZmU3HX8TkYeqlZkyMvdeKqk5rqpzre6GfZrb4ANGBgRukfYtAFjMjXnPTvTb8VPN-v7f7VrCM0LptPSYW3dx0p1vTvWs9fX58z18jFQ2XdhzcbGOEpa7etsWfSq5_kWA45ayGZJzR_qXlrWROKM2En5gQnMsWf2bU9BcaQdcza3MZM1p3OTxJMqtNF8AMEcNaS7uE26E8HwwekophqH0tMeA-QLTjAt5gKkDwCffBazhDhFSh-8GiYbJTVAopKZPqCaQiFIIywSUl9Qe_1av43_4PVdyTlA), the company had partnerships running with Bosch, BP, Anheuser-Busch, etc. while lying about having a working prototype/technology. 

**Valuation**

The company is currently valued at $125 Billion which is a hard swallow for most investors. One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers‚Äô valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.

What we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,

&gt;Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  
Tesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue

Even if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \~130k vehicles in 2023 and \~400k vehicles in 2025.

Granted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.

This brings us to..

The actual production numbers for 2021 are \~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.

Even though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.

Rivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford‚Äôs F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.

The pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders. I brought this up as extended delays in delivery might change the minds of customers who might opt for an option that is more easily available.  

**Conclusion**

Without a doubt, Rivian is a fantastic company. It‚Äôs the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don‚Äôt think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \[5\].

Even if you are sold on the company‚Äôs vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.

If you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won‚Äôt substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.

So here's how I see things going forward:

1. Dumb money is here to stay. There's just too damn much of it flooding the market looking for a home. 

2. Retail investor sentiment has changed. No one is risk-adverse on a broad scale anymore. Investors are willing to hold through dips and plunge more cash into them.

3. Interest rates are rock bottom, and there's the possibility they stay that way or go negative due to debt implications if they're raised.

What's going to change? Is retail suddenly going to become risk adverse? Is the amount of capital flooding the system going to be reigned in? Are interest rates going to drastically rise, if at all?

But I've also seen people say it's smart to hold bonds because if the market tanks and you lose your job etc. then at least you will have the bonds to sell if needed since those won't be way down. For instance, espoused here [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5025565#p5025565](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5025565#p5025565).

I'm a bit confused because these two principals seem directly contradictory to me. If the bonds are going into the 401k then they are a poor source of 'safe' money should the market tank, due to withdrawal taxes. But if they are accessible in a taxable account then it's not a tax-efficient fund placement. Am I missing something?

For context I'm trying to decide, in my taxable account, between 100% VTWAX or something like 90% VTWAX/10% bonds and increasing the bond amount over time to match a target date fund.

Any corporation with largely outsourced operations or jobs with high satisfaction (think big tech, luxury, private equity, etc.) will be minimally impacted; 

companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Costco, which already have higher paying jobs will likely benefit as their competitors (who often rely on low wage workers) take a large hit and are able to absorb rising labour costs better;

obviously, McDonald's (which is a particular target), Walmart, etc. will suffer a bit.

Inelastic industries may additionally benefit, as will, I suspect, automation, logistics (outsourcing increases demand), UX software companies (for corps that don't have in house programmers), etc.

A person familiar with the situation stated on Thursday that certain bondholders of China Evergrande Group have received coupon payments from the embattled property developer, easing concerns about a possibly destabilising default.

Earlier this week, Chinese news site Callanish reported that many bondholders had received interest payments from three bond tranches that owed **a total of more than $148 million in interest payments due last month but had a grace period that ended on Wednesday.**

Because they were not authorized to speak to the media, the source declined to be identified. A request for comment from Evergrande was not returned.

Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer, has been missing deadlines in recent weeks as it deals with **more than $300 billion in liabilities, $19 billion of which are international market bonds.**

Failure to pay would have resulted in the company's formal default and triggered cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar debts, aggravating the world's second-largest economy's debt problem.

Evergrande's Hong Kong-listed shares had risen more than 9% by mid-morning on the news that the latest deadline had been reached. A financial crisis has weighed on the sector, threatening hundreds of projects, and the corporation, which also has **coupon payments totaling more than $255 million due on December 28**, has come under strain.

The market is also keeping an eye on rival **Kaisa Group**, which has $59 million in coupon payments due on Thursday and Friday. After Evergrande, Kaisa has the biggest offshore debt of any Chinese developer. Kaisa, which has missed a payment on a wealth management product, was **downgraded by S&amp;P to ‚ÄúCCC-‚Äù from ‚ÄúCCC+‚Äù with a negative outlook on Thursday**, following a similar action by Moody‚Äôs.

The rating agency said Kaisa‚Äôs liquidity appears to be depleted, and it expects a default scenario is inevitable within the next six months. China‚Äôs property woes have rattled global markets since September despite Beijing‚Äôs efforts to reassure markets the crisis would not be allowed to spiral out of control. Regulators and government think-tanks have held meetings with developers in the past few weeks, and the market is expecting some easing in credit and housing policies to prevent a hard landing of the sector.

**Besides, the Federal Reserve warned on Monday that stress in China's real estate sector ""poses considerable risk to the US financial system."" See details on** [**westmoney**](https://www.westmoney10.com/share/stocknewsdetail?lang=zh&amp;id=909766865776152576&amp;color=1&amp;wm=reddit)

This equals $1,093.14 if redeemed for statement credit or deposited into a bank account. If redeemed this amount through Chase Ultimate Rewards for travel for the 1.25X points value this increases the value to $1,366.42.

In the past, valuations and fundamentals have mattered because the big institutions and the average retail investor thought they mattered. Even algos, which on some level were active at the onset of the 80's were programmed and directed to sell off stock when the valuation became too absurd. 

But when I look at the Rivians and Nikolas of the world I start to think maybe they're just a symptom of the larger mentality of the market, including institutions, including the algos that are programmed by humans that have normal human biases.

Theoretically, if the larger consensus of the market.. from institutions to retail to the programmers making algos, was that only future potential growth mattered and nothing else, wouldn't that theoretically mean that only growth and hype stocks would have growth and interest forever? 

I mean on a purely theoretical level, if we reached a point where it was a consensus by the vast majority of investors from all levels and backgrounds was that speculation and growth wins the day, wouldn't the market reflect that?

What I mean to say is the market can be a reflection of the risk appetite of the broad spectrum of humans investing and trading in it, and if that were to slowly shift would it be possible that value stocks or old blue chips are largely forgotten forever, or have a bad return versus hype/speculation/growth moving forward?

If no one is a Warren Buffett anymore, why would Warren Buffett-esque stocks have any market beating returns? No one would invest in them (on a level compared to hype/speculation stocks).

But is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?

Tesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.

So this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries. And with the asumption that Tesla suppliers will be able to grow at a similar rate and that all the copper/alum/etc mines will be able to satisfy the demand.

**Important data**

Elon said that they will search where to build more factories in 2022 and that they will announce the location in 2023.

The calculation is based on the premise that the factories will be built in 12 months and that they will be able to go at max output instantly. Elon said that they will increase their max output of the factories by 50% next year, so in the calculation in the 1st year the factories will have a max output of 500.000 cars and in the next 750.000.

**Result: Supply doesnt meet the demand**

&amp;#x200B;

This shows that in 2030 Tesla wont be able to grow at a 40% rate unless it builds more factories than in this analysis. In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.

In my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.

Internal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. 

One main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.

**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**

In my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.

**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**"|investing|Is 2030 the best time to sell tesla? - Analysis of its Production Capacity Growth|0.0|0.35|['Starlink', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'BYD', 'Tesla', 'GER']

I have an econ prof who told my class that in the long run, he believed that inflation and money supply growth would match up. Many people tend to agree with this classical theory, so I took a few hours and looked into it.

What I found was that m2 money supply, since 1961 has compounded annually at about 7.1% while CPI inflation has compounded annually at about 3.2%.

To me, based on the above facts I'd argue that, over the past 60 years inflation and money supply haven't shown a relationship approximating the classical economic theory.

Driver capacity was down around 40% last quarter. And the ride-hailing giants are investing heavily in driver wage and benefit increases to incentivize them to return to the platforms.

The consensus average1-year revenue growth estimate is 45.89%, and the earnings growth estimate is 26.74%. The current market price is $ 45.12 while the 1-year average price target is $ 68.01 - that represents a 50.73% upside potential.

AMZN 1.52% warehouse employees in the New York City borough of Staten Island have withdrawn their petition with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election at four company warehouses, a labor board spokeswoman said Friday. 

 The fledgling union, which calls itself the Amazon Labor Union, said it had to withdraw because the labor board, a federal agency that oversees collective bargaining, had communicated that it no longer had adequate support to move forward with an election.

  To meet the requirement, unions typically have to collect signatures from 30% of workers showing support. The change came after many workers who had shown support for a union left the company, according to Chris Smalls, a former Amazon employee who leads the group. He said the union planned to collect more signature cards and refile for an election.  ‚ÄúAs soon as we can get enough cards, we‚Äôll resubmit,‚Äù he said. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company‚Äôs focus ‚Äúremains on listening directly to our employees and continuously improving on their behalf.‚Äù

 The union push in New York is the biggest challenge to Amazon of organized labor since a failed unionization effort earlier this year in Alabama.  It also represents another battle for Amazon at its New York hub. In 2018, Amazon had selected the city as part of its so-called ‚ÄúHQ2‚Äô‚Äô development around the same time union leaders had been rallying support for workers to unionize on Staten Island. The union effort fizzled out, though Amazon also abandoned its HQ2 plans in New York.

I‚Äôm a bit new to the investing game so my apologies if I missed the discussions on this. I followed the GameStoo saga earlier this year and recently started looking again at the two big subreddits supporting it.

To my understanding, the theory goes that the shorts never actually sold their positions (because they would have gone bankrupt), but instead used all sorts of trickery to delay and avoid.

It‚Äôs a written explanation of the business and its goals based on that interview, along with quotes from the two:

Phunware is a mobile platform that allows people to monetize their data (whether political data for politicians or marketing data for companies) with native cryptocurrency to engage with politicians/companies in a decentralized way, allowing users to ‚Äúvoluntarily opt-in‚Äù to the use of their data. This allows constituents/consumers to monetize their verifiable data on a blockchain in order to reflect their interests to candidates/companies, and this helps them produce more connected campaigns or more satisfactory consumer goods/services. Politicians are incentivized to pay for political data because it is the backbone of winning any campaign, and constituents are incentivized to engage with their politicians to have their views reflected. Same goes for consumers and the businesses that require their revenue to survive.

Phunware seeks to compete with traditional advertising‚Äîparticularly social media‚Äîby redefining how constituents engage with their politicians. The Trump 2020 campaign was planning to outsource their data intelligence to Salesforce, but campaign insider Brad Parscale recognized the reality that this company was the only company that could do so.

Many retail traders don't know what it means or how to respond. More specifically, many are having trouble with tailoring their portfolios to either avoid risk or take advantage of inflationary circumstances. I aim to somewhat remedy this. I hope the pointers below will help you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. This is not the end all or be all and I welcome your observations and comments on what I could have missed. Enjoy this and lets make some money taking advantage of these once in a lifetime economic circumstances.

* **Inflations is Measured by a Change in Rate:** Inflation doesn't usually go down. The RATE of inflation goes up or down, but inflation itself is persistent. This is by design. Could you imagine what would happen to the economy if you knew that your dollar would be worth more tomorrow than it is today? Spending on goods other than necessities would come to a very dramatic reduction (*Note: You might be rethinking crypto right now huh?*). So it is important to understand that what we are looking at is the CHANGE IN RATE of inflation. There is no deflation!! Deflation is 1000x worse for the economy than inflation. So do not expect deflation. The Fed simply will not allow it. Nor should they!
* **Current Inflation is Largely a Result of too Much Demand:** During the COVID lock downs many businesses were forced to grind their operations to a halt. Remember food, toilet paper, &amp; other essentials flying off the shelves? Indeed many grocery stores were limiting the amount of water you could buy. It only stands to reason that when you force businesses to close down you create a situation where the goods that people demand are not being replaced by a steady supply. So what happens as the economy opens back up? Suddenly those same businesses have reduced inventories, they need to hire back workers, they need to order new supplies, &amp; they need to meet an increased demand as a result of some competitors closing their doors for good. Now the quantity of goods demanded well exceeds the quantity of goods supplied ... on all fronts. Reopening firms are competing against other reopening firms for the same raw materials, supplies, resources, shipping, etc. They are also competing for the same labor pool. Remember that goods &amp; services in times of extreme scarcity go to the highest bidder.
* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand (Or too Little Supply):** Below you will find the inflationary issues we find ourselves in as a result of increased demand and limited supply. Below each topic you will also find some examples of how to profit from each. You will also receive some examples of secondary and tertiary effects of each.
* **Supply Chain Bottlenecks:** First and foremost in the news are the supply chain bottlenecks. We've all seen the ships floating off the Port of Los Angeles, or the very long line of trucks waiting to pick up freight from the ports. The United States &amp; Europe have but a limited number of ports and they're taking on all the supplies that firms ordered as the economy opened back up. Making things worse ... its holiday shopping season. So cost of shipping dry bulk overseas is not just rising as a result of increased demand, but as a result of the fact that it costs money to have all these carriers waiting weeks to offload their goods. Making matters worse many of the imported goods are perishables which can spoil and reduce the supply of foodstuffs amid an already high demand. As a result many firms are opting for alternative methods of shipping like the much more expensive option of air freight.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on sea freight carriers, rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Supply Chain Shortages:** As if the bottlenecks weren't bad enough, there are but a limited number of domestic shipping firms. Firms that not only transport materials to businesses, or, finished goods to retailers, but also delivering orders to retail shoppers. Here we are once again talking about rail, trucking, mail delivery, air freight, logistics firms, logistics outsourcing, etc. So yet again we have an increased demand for shipping and logistics with but a limited supply. And while this demand will keep up for some time, many firms know it will eventually come back down to normal, and therefore, are very hesitant to expand too fast too quickly for fear that they will one day have too much fleet for future business.

**(*****Note: Moderately bullish on rail, trucking, logistics, logistics outsourcing, and air freight*****)**

* **Semiconductor Shortages:** Everything these days has a semiconductor. Whether its semiconductors, passive semiconductors, diodes, you name it, chances are if it was an electronic made in the last 5 years, it needs a semiconductor to properly operate. Indeed before the supply chain shortages hit critical mass, we were dealing with semiconductor shortages. Now we will not likely fix the semiconductor issue until we fix the supply chain issue. Once again as the economy opened back up &amp; demand skyrocketed, semiconductors too experienced a complementary spike in demand. Semiconductors alone are preventing the automakers from producing at full capacity. There are not enough semiconductors to make vehicles. And with the holidays on the horizon semiconductors are in higher demand than ever. Even Sony had to reduce the number of PlayStations they could manufacture and ship due to component shortages and logistics issues. So expect the price of any new electronic device that has a semiconductor to increase in price.

**(*****Note: Bullish on electronics &amp; semiconductors*****)**

* **Vehicle Shortages:** As noted with the semiconductors, vehicles are in short supply. As a result the quantity of vehicles demanded exceed the quantity of vehicles supplied. Therefore we not only have a shortage of vehicles but the price o vehicles have skyrocketed. Have you seen the empty lots at your local dealership? There's nothing to sell! People are ordering direct from factory. As a result people turned toward used vehicles which now are also in short supply. As a result people who could not afford the increased price of used vehicles resulted to maintaining their current vehicles. And as a result of people maintaining their current vehicles, the demand for auto parts &amp; auto mechanics have skyrocketed. And I don't know many large firms that do not need a frequent supply of vehicles to maintain operations.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish to bullish on used car firms, auto parts, and car repair***\*\*)\*\*

* **Raw Material Shortages:** Raw materials were the first to explode out of COVID. Wood, steel, ore, oil, &amp; minerals ... you name it, its all going up. The quantity of supply demanded exceed the current supply ... and for many reasons.

**(Note:** ***Moderately bullish on miners, steel, mining equipment suppliers, and oil/gas producers ... see energy shortage below for more detail on oil/gas***\*\*)\*\*

* **Increased Demand for Housing:** Largely as a result of low interest rates incentivizing lending, we experienced a housing and construction boom in the middle of a Pandemic. Houses and industrial builds in many areas have skyrocketed in value. But this was not only as a result of low interest rates. When the federal government instituted a ban on evictions from rental properties, many took advantage by simply not paying their rent. The forgone payments to the landlord forced the renter to pass on the costs on to new tenants, which increased the cost of rental properties beyond that just owning a home in many areas. So people bought homes instead. Moreover many people moved out of urban areas to escape burdensome COVID restrictions which furthermore increased the demand of housing. Furthermore lifetime renting millennials saw the low interest rates as a great time to buy their first home. Finally, mortgage forbearance reduced a lot of foreclosures during COVID. Less foreclosures means less supply, less supply amid high demand results in higher prices.

**(Note:** ***Not very bullish on housing &amp; real estate at this time but still moderately bullish on construction, furniture, paint, fixtures, and infrastructure***\*\*).\*\*

* **Energy Shortages:** As we began to put the COVID economy behind us, more people are travelling to work, to school, and going on vacation. More recently international travel is opening back up.  Moreover firms are expanding rapidly to meet demand and shippers are using more energy than ever. This all of course increases the price of oil, natural gas, jet fuel, and the fuel you pay at the pump. Making matters worse, no matter what your politics are, the current administration in the White House is the most ardently unfriendly domestic coal and fossil fuel administrations we've had in 5 years. OPEC, perhaps realizing that such demand will be but temporary for the next 1-2 years, refuses to entertain the Biden administrations request to ramp up oil supply. Oddly enough big oil hasn't been in this good of a position for the last 4 years where the increase of supply made it seriously hard for oil firms to profit. Energy is used for producing everything. When energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. When energy goes up, people spend more on energy and less on other things. So the increase in energy costs are a result of both increased post COVID demand and politics. Of all the issues we are experiencing with inflated prices, energy is among the easiest to fix.

**(Note: B*****ullish on oil, natural gas, oil and natural gas equipment maintainers and suppliers, and perhaps oil exploration if the Biden administration would quit putting up road blocks***\*\*)\*\*

* **Worker Shortages:** ""Worker Shortages"" is misleading. When people think of a ""worker shortage"" they generally think that we don't have enough workers to meet demand. They would be correct. But we should phrase it as ""firms do not have enough workers to meet CURRENT demand."" Lets face it we are rear view looking creatures. Simply because a firm doesn't have enough workers does not indicate that they cant beat previous profit/revenue, but rather they can not only beat previous revenue projections, but also be in a position where they cannot meet CURRENT demand. And just like anything else, when the quantity of labor demanded exceeds the quantity of labor supplied, we run into increased labor costs ... namely wages. And wages are overwhelmingly the highest cost for most firms. 

**(Note:** ***Bullish on staffing and outsourcing firms***\*\*)\*\*

* **Secondary &amp; Tertiary Effects of too Much Demand ... Conclusion:** Lets keep this simple. You want to buy a car. That car is made from raw materials such as aluminum &amp; steel. The car requires electronics. Those electronics require semiconductors. You need a labor force to put that car together. You need energy to manufacture that car. You need truckers &amp; freighters to ship those cars or bring manufacturers the materials to make cars. You need equipment to make cars. In short 100% of the price of all components of that car, or the components used to make that car, have gone up. Still, you have a high demand market where people and businesses require vehicles, but the manufacturer cant meet that demand due to the lack of supplies available. Nevertheless the vehicle manufacturer still needs to pay for overhead costs to keep the doors open. And as so many people are demanding such a short supply of cars, the manufacturers simply increase the price of that car to meet the demand of the highest paying bidders. And this phenomenon is happening in each step of the chain to make that car from the folks who supply the materials, to the folks who produce the energy, to the folks who ship the finished product. When the quantity of goods demanded exceed the quantity of goods supplied, prices necessarily must go up.
* **Monetary Drivers of Inflation:**  As a result of the dramatic initial downward shift in demand amid COVID lockdowns, the Federal Reserve made money cheap, essentially lowering interests rates to both incentivize borrowing and make borrowing more affordable. The result? Massive influxes of borrowing and lending which in turn flooded the economy with cash. At first this excess cash was used to make it through the pandemic. Later this cash was used by firms to expand rapidly to meet demand. People also used cheap money via extremely low interest rates to purchase homes, which increased the demand for housing. Eventually the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates to disincentive lending and cool off a hot economy. If allowed to persist for too long the influx of cash will lead to investments by firms looking to to stave off losing the value of money via inflation and thereby creating a massive bubble. There are already indicators of this happening by virtue of equity valuations in the market. (*Note: the Fed has also been incentivizing investment in the stock market by buying treasury bonds on the secondary market which resulted in keeping the yields artificially low. As a result people were less inclined to buy treasury bonds and more incentivized to invest in other equity*).
* **Government Drivers of Inflation:** The rapid inflation we are experiencing has not deterred President Biden for advocating for trillions in spending measures. The U.S. Government is a customer just like anyone else, and the government competes for the same goods and services you and I do. Increased spending will to some extent result in crowding out the private sector that competes for the same goods and services. Remember that an increase in demand with limited supply generally results increased prices. If the government spends too much, it can seriously hurt consumers in the form of increased prices. Moreover the Biden administration isn't the most friendly administration when it comes to mining for coal, oil, minerals, etc.. This inevitably leads to increased costs of energy and raw materials. (*Note: This comment used a political figure as an example of a negative economic consequence. Do me a favor, take the example for what its worth to you, and realize I am not going to entertain heated political discussion. There is a cost and benefit to everything, and I don't have the time to entertain the talking points you pulled from a political webpage or favorable news site and tell you why you're wrong, when no matter how much the evidence is stacked against you, you're not going to change your mind anyway. Ergo a massive waste of time that benefits no one*).
* **Inflation is Excellent for Debt!:** I will keep this one quick. Lets say you took out a 30 year fixed mortgage in 1990. You paid $90,000 for your home and have a mortgage of $400 per month. In the year 2019 your home is now worth $200,000 in market value but you're still paying $400 per month at a fixed rate. Through inflation your wages have eventually increased while your fixed rate mortgage remained stagnant. In short, you may have been scrimping for pennies when you took out the mortgage, but years later you can make your payment while working at a fast food restaurant. Neat huh? Inflation is excellent for debt ridden companies. As their profit margins increase over time through inflation they will find it much easier to pay off their long term debt. (*Note: Perhaps this put some of the companies you were looking at into better perspective, and if debt was a major factor for not investing, then you may or may not want to revisit your decision.*)
* **Bullish Sectors You Can Profit From that I did not Mention Above:** Industrial Chemicals, Industrial Equipment, Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction, and Pesticides. As firms ramp up production they will increase the demand for industrial chemicals. Moreover, as food prices continue to increase the more land farmers will be incentivized to clear for additional farming which requires more farming construction, farming equipment, chemicals/pesticides, and fertilizers.
* **The Canary in the Inflation Coal Mine:** If the change in prices rise beyond the change in incomes to the point where people need to start economizing their necessities and forgoing their wants, we could be looking at a very serious correction.

**Conclusion:** I hope the pointers above have helped you better understand the inflationary environment and identify economically favorable industries/sectors. Please understand that I will be reading this over and over again to identify typos &amp; unclear sentences. I may even edit it as people bring ideas to my attention. Anyway I hope you enjoyed it and can turn this into long term investment opportunities."|investing|Understanding and Profiting from our Current Inflationary Environment|395.0|0.85|['Industrial Chemicals', 'The U.S. Government', 'Supply Chain Shortages:*', 'Industrial Equipment', 'Fertilizers, Farm Equipment/Construction', 'Tertiary Effects', 'The United States &', 'Fed', 'the White House', 'OPEC', 'Sony', 'the Federal Reserve', 'PlayStations', 'Change']

I want to take my investing a lot more seriously and learn more about financial reporting and different ways to interpret these metrics. I studied mathematics in school, just not finance and accounting, so I think a modern book that is not overly academic but not horribly shy of more challenging discussions would be a good fit for me. I don't have the time right now to do a lot of research from ground zero, so a good crowd sourcing of resources would at least get me on the right track (and then I can review reviews of text books and see some previews on my own time).

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and ‚Äúlower for longer‚Äù has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low ‚Äúneutral real interest rate‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks‚Äô struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits‚Äîbecause it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding‚Äîas well as smaller and more specialized banks‚Äîhave suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing ‚Äúlow-for-long‚Äù environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven‚Äôt more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems‚Äîbecause of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets‚Äîmay be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit‚Äîeven if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later."|investing|The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely worked according to an IMF paper|26.0|0.71|[]

[https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pink-simplify-health-care-etf](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pink-simplify-health-care-etf)

The  ETF is run by Michael Taylor, a hedge fund manager with a reputation  among hedge fund (health) pods at being one of the best invididual company pickers -  particularly among health/pharma/medtech/biotech. The expense ratio  minus trading/legal fees is also being **donated entirely to charity**,  although at 0.50 it's low for an active ETF. Mike's been running his  hedge fund for over a decade, so this is the first opportunity retail  investors have to take advantage of his management.

My  circumstance also is that I have a bunch of individual holdings in my  personal portfolio, but I need something to round out my health exposure  as I'm nowhere near competent to pick myself in the health space. I've  been slowly adding to PINK and wanted to go a bit into my decision  process on how I choose an active manager. In my case I've been  following Mike on twitter for a while so I already know his strengths:  he is not just good at ""picking stocks"" but he also gets **portfolio construction** and **market cycles**...particularly in the health space.

See ARKG for an example of how **not**  to do portfolio construction. In short, don't go ""all-in"" on a single  factor (i.e. long duration early-stage growth in ARGK's case). Going all  in on a single factor works when it works, but when it doesn't work you  are stuck bag-holding at an inopportune time in the cycle and selling  low to meet outflows. Mixing up the factors helps with regards to moving  capital from whatever is trading expensive (relatively) to whatever is  trading cheaper on a factor basis.

As of this posting, you can see a mix of mega-cap blue chips and concentrated ""bets"" in his top 20.

* **Mega-cap Blue chips**: UNH, PFE, ABT, JNJ, ANTM, LLY, ..
* **Concentrated bets**: DXCM, UTHR, ZTS, HZNP, LIVN, LNTH, ...

Obviously  Mike is going for some individual company alpha with some of the  concentrated bets. There is also an overweight on medtech throughout the  portfolio relative to XLV. IMO this is due to medtech having  under-earned as an industry throughout 2020-2021 and they are likely to  resume normal earnings in 2022.

If  you want to see another example of good portfolio construction, see  PRNHX (T Rowe New Horizons). It's a closed fund so does not accept new  investors...but has been beating the S&amp;P500 performance handily for  30+ years.

Similar style...it mixes up innovative/disruptive small/mid cap growth  bets with more conservative holdings.

I had a busy morning, just came home for a break in between, and checked my phone. Apparently Elon Musk promised to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla based on the results of a Twitter poll to make a political point about taking unrealized gains. Sure enough, Tesla is down significantly (and yes, it may be smart to ""buy the dip"" here but these actions have potential legal consequences).

Honestly, I agree that taxing unrealized gains is insane. But that's not the point of this post. The point is at what point are Musk's antics an actual liability for the company, as compared to him being tied into the companies brand? 

In my honest opinion, I don't think he's responsible enough to be a CEO and he seems to have no concept of responsible governance. I'm no lawyer, but my first thought was that he is exposing his company to legal liability for a political point, and honestly that's no way to govern a corporation. And the kicker is that this isn't the first time.

Virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse. I daresay these are just the starting points to the entrance to a whole new alternate universe.

AMD has partnerships with Microsoft and Sony for gaming console chips and now has signed up Meta (Facebook) as a new customer. We all know what Facebook was planning when it changed name to Meta and AMD is going to benefit tremendously from this partnership.

It's gradually taking away market share from Intel and soon we will reach a point where Intel might not even be a competitor to AMD. While the need for CPUs is here to stay, most future tech would be based on GPUs, a sector where AMD has a strong footing.

Have a long position in AMD, bought at 115. Would buy more before it hits 200.

Edit: adding a section to explain why GPUs would support future AI and VR tech more than CPUs.

GPUs are better at performing mathematical and geometric calculations than CPUs. That's why they are crucial for AI/ML and VR.
This is also why GPUs are used intensively for crypto mining. 
CPUs are crucial for putting everything together and perform code and logic processing. That's why GPUs won't replace CPUs but as we move towards more complex requirements for altverse, we would need powerful CPUs but we would need much more advanced GPUs. For instance take high end pc games. High end games can run on a mid-end I5 CPU but need a high end GPU.

4. Global infrastructure ($IGF)
5. Direct landing (Yieldstreet? Worth checking the fee structure and the underlying products)

[SPD](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/spd-simplify-us-equity-plus-downside-convexity-etf) is basically an S&amp;P500 ETF with partial exposure to put options to hedge against market crashes. So you sacrifice a bit of potential gains in a bull market but actually can make even also make money in a crash. This ETF could be probably used as a big or even as the only part of a portfolio. 

[CYA](https://www.simplify.us/etfs/cya-simplify-tail-risk-strategy-etf) is a hedging ETF probably not intended to be the main part of a portfolio. It's financing through a rather complicated options strategy a short exposure on the stock market by going short on volalility, so basically it tries to position you constantly short on the stock market without losing money in a bull market. In combination with the VOO or other ETFs it could function as a hedging mechanism for the portfolio.

Both ETFs have compared to completely passive ETFs like VOO rather expensive fees of 0.54% and 0.75% but you could argue that it's actually relatively cheap for an actively managed fund. Both ETFs are very new and have basically no track record and I think it's also difficult to back test because of the rather complicated options strategy.

1636379546.0|0.0|t3_qpe2gt|964.0|"Across the new sources I read, the consensus seems to be that the market is pricing in the first rate hike around Summer 22. The magnitude of the expected rate hike is tiny, maybe a quarter-percent. If you are of the belief that supply-chain shortages will last well into 2022, this is hilariously inadequate.

First, we've seen from 10 years of monetary experiments that the direct relationship between inflation and the state of the economy + monetary policy is tenuous at best. And this has benefitted the economy at large as we have pumped more and more money and cheap debt into the system with no apparent ill effects (except the ones that we choose to ignore, but I'm not here to beat that debt horse!). So it's already ridiculous to believe that the converse won't also be true. A 25 basis-point increase will do nothing to temper inflation.

Second, we have a new phenomenon that *does* seem to have a strong connection to inflation, both in theory and in practice. Inflation expectations among spenders and workers are higher than they've been in over a decade, wage increases at the bottom are faster than they've been in over a decade, and supply chains are more constricted than they've been in a decade.

Thus, if inflation persists, even at the not-hyper-inflation levels we're currently seeing, it's not a stretch to see that the Fed will have to make moves that shatter the confidence driving the second point. Once you accept the first point, that the Fed's tools have a weak causal relationship with inflation, it's clear that the only way they can stop inflation is to raise interest rates enough to tank assets, which will shake consumer confidence and bring demand in equilibrium with supply. If that isn't enough, they will be forced to go further and cause a recession, although this will take a lot of pushing, given their need to balance against the full employment mandate. Either way, I think we can all agree a quarter rate increase will do nothing.

I'm curious what other people's thoughts are. I'm not making any earth-shattering new statements, just connecting dots. To me, this outcome flows logically from the two points above, *if* you believe that higher inflation (but not hyper-inflation) will be persistent into next year."|investing|IMO the market is strongly underestimating the magnitude of rate hikes required to temper inflation|964.0|0.89|['Fed']

so I'm not sure I understand the very basics of options, or at the very least, I'm confused by the existence of far OTM options.

Let's just use an example with simple numbers (The numbers are OBVIOUSLY not correct, they're just in the ballpark). The stock of ABC Corp is trading at $100 a share, with ""decent"" volatility. 

An ATM Call with Strike Price ~100$ is trading at 10$, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 110$.

A deep ITM Call with Strike Price ~50$ is trading at 55$, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 115$.

A deep OTM Call with Strike Price ~200$ is trading at $1, to breakeven I'd need the underlying to trade at 201$.

Between the ATM and ITM, the difference looks to be clear: I need less of an upswing to make a profit with the ATM, but have a higher chance of losing what I paid for the option.

However, I don't understand the OTM call at all. Let's say I bet on the underlying suddenly increasing a ton, which is why I want to buy the OTM. Now, most likely, this is not going to happen, and I lose the $100(100*1$) I paid. But my confusion arises from the scenario where the price does break above the $200. Let's assume the price of the underlying is suddenly 205$:

My deep OTM would only yield (205-201)\*100=400$, even though I took this enormous risk! And even weirder, my ATM call would yield (205-110)\*100=9500$!

*So not only would I take way less risk by buying an ATM/ITM, I would ALSO profit MORE?* Clearly, this can't be right. What am I getting wrong here? Isn't it usually that the upsides of investments with greater risk tend to be greater, even if they happen with less probability? Yes, I paid less premium, but what interests me isn't the exact premium I paid, but rather the difference between currentQuote and (strikePrice+cost), since that's my profit."|investing|Understanding far OTM options|24.0|0.82|['ITM Call', 'ATM', 'ITM', 'OTM', 'ABC Corp']

Second, bubbles are inherently difficult to time and identify because they can persist longer than we may think is rational. I have only been loosely following Rich and his team for a few years because they seem to offer good contrarian points of view and those are valuable to get. Anyone that has long term experience following Rich may be able to provide feedback on his track record. 

RBA‚Äôs team has identified 5 characteristics found in every financial market bubble and they lay out how each one is present in today‚Äôs market in the US. I‚Äôll lay out their 5 points and the underlying rationale for each with supporting charts from RBA. 

1. Increased Liquidity 

The Federal Reserve has provided enormous levels of liquidity in response to COVID as evidenced by the simple growth in money supply. However this liquidity has been trapped in the financial markets due to bank‚Äôs lending and capital restraints implemented post-GFC. Since bank lending is supposed to be the mechanism through which monetary stimulus gets into the economy, their lack of high margin lending from low interest rates has inhibited money from leaving the financial markets. 

[M2 Money Supply](https://imgur.com/a/eNzFzhp)

2. Increased Use of Leverage

The increased use of leverage is indicated by the number of investors who have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. RBA references a survey from MagnifyMoney that showed 40% of individual investors have borrowed money to invest in the stock market. Almost half of those that borrowed has borrowed at least $5,000.

[Individual Investors Debt survey](https://imgur.com/a/M0uuYHR)

Investors have also added leverage through the increased use of options. Option volume still remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. 

[Retail Option volume](https://imgur.com/a/ArLgTut)

3. Democratization of Markets

Every bubble has a component of ‚Äúeveryone gets to play‚Äù. Chat boards, increased ease of trading, and meme stocks all make this quite evident. Below shows how trading has shifted to individual stocks, leverage is on the rise, and Google searches are driving option volumes. 



[Democratization of Markets](https://imgur.com/a/BGGEoeI)

4. Increased New Issues 

Investors‚Äô desire to hold stocks or the bubble asset grows and the amount of new issues in a market grows significantly during bubbles. Cheap financing and issuance costs are driving the flood of SPACs and IPOs. Many of these new issues are tremendously speculative and serve the issuer more than the investor. The number of SPAC IPOs and the size of them have both popped. 

[SPAC volume and size](https://imgur.com/a/etMKycD)

5. Increased Turnover 

Trading volumes tend to rapidly increase during bubbles like day trading popped during the Tech bubble and flipping houses became the rage during the housing bubble. 

[Total Trading Volume is elevated](https://imgur.com/a/pylJXwh)


RBA goes on to emphasize this does not mean the entire market is at risk. They point out only 3 sectors have outperformed the market over the last 3 years (Tech, Comm Svc, and Cons Disc). The rest of the sectors and small-caps have been left behind. 

[Sector Performance](https://imgur.com/a/I8TvxAl)

Lastly, the bubble assets usually take a long time to recover. It took the NASDAQ 14 years to recover from the Tech bubble. 

[NASDAQ post Tech bubble](https://imgur.com/a/oWtA3B7)

However, they also demonstrate timing the bubble is not necessary. You could have been 3 years early selling bubble assets and buying the undervalued segments of the markets and still came out ahead during the Tech bubble.

The final vote was 228-206. Thirteen Republicans voted with the majority of Democrats in support of the bill, though six Democrats voted against it.
The bill now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, following hours of delayes and internal debating among Democrats on Friday, including calls from Biden to persuade skeptical progressive members of the Democratic caucus.
The legislation passed the Senate in August, but was stalled in the House as Democrats tried to negotiate a deal on a separate $1.9 trillion economic package, another key component of Biden's agenda that many Democrats had tied to the fate of the infrastructure bill.
The legislation will deliver $550 billion of new federal investments in America's infrastructure over five years, including money for roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package includes a $65 billion investment in improving the nation's broadband infrastructure, and invests tens of billions of dollars in improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion would go to building a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers, according to the bill text.
Biden called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just before midnight to congratulate her on the passage of the infrastructure bill, a source familiar with the call tells CNN. On the call, Pelosi thanked Biden for his help in getting the bill over the finish line as well.

I recently came across Nutanix which is a company I've heard of but didn't realize was public. Nutanix is the industry leader in hyperconvered infrastructure (HCI) which essentially makes them a competitor to vmware, dell, cisco, etc. in the on-prem virtualization space. I was doing some reading and it seems like their products are highly regarded in the industry. I also noticed they are growing hybrid cloud subscription services (SaaS) that can help customers abstract their cloud computing workloads away (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem can all be run from a single pane). I don't know exactly where they stand in this industry but evidently we are at peak cloud and large companies are starting to move workloads back out of the cloud to save money. Not to say cloud won't continue huge growth, but there is a trend of massive companies moving out of AWS,GCP,Azure due to cost, and fear of vendor lock-in. This creates opportunity for the hybrid cloud market which should see accelerated growth.

This company used to sell hardware but has recently undergone a transition into a subscription services company. This transition was painful and led to nearly no stock growth over 4 years. However with new leadership it looks like the company is pulling off the transition and starting to grow again.

Looks like a lot of execs have left the company but some well respected fresh leadership has come in (RR is CEO who used to be COO at vmware).

They currently operate at a loss but according to the new leadership will be cash-flow positive sometime in 2022. currently the company has

1.64 Billion annual revenue

As of this quarter 19% YoY revenue growth

83% annual recurring revenue

7.7 billion market cap

Heavily funded by bain capital

cost of revenue 78 million

The main difference between preferred and common stock is that **preferred stock gives no voting rights to shareholders** while common stock does. Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.

When you invest in a crowdfunding/Pre-IPO there are different type of shares offered. Can you keep your preferred shares or should you convert them to common stock once the investment open market?

Or are you even able to keep them in preferred shares?

I found this note regarding this.  Is this true:

&gt;sometimes the privates shares may not become free trading. Typically, when a registration statement is filed with the SEC, the shares covered by the reg statement are listed. If your shares are part of that filing, then, once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, the shares would be deemed to be free trading. Mechanically, once a registration statement is effective, a company needs to have a Form 15c2‚Äì11 filed by a FINRA broker-dealer that completes the listing process on a national securities exchange - giving the shareholder of the now free trading shares a platform to actually sell such shares. That said, if your shares are not included in a registration statement, the IPO will not directly change the nature of the shares. However, the shareholder could later utilize the Rule 144 exemption after a 6 month holding period (all things considered), which would remove the restriction from resale on the shares  


And also:

&gt;An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the first sale of stock by a company to the public. A company can either raise money by issuing debt, or equity (shares), to public or private buyers.

&gt;Only private companies can carry out an IPO when they want ‚Äòto go public‚Äô.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although an IPO raises a large amount of capital: becoming publicly traded results in stricter regulations and rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of conversion, shares are not converted unless the shareholder has elected to convert some of his shares to a public offering.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The differences between public and private shares are:**  
&gt;  
&gt;Publicly traded shares are sold on an established stock exchange. Ultimately providing liquidity to the company or the shareholder who has decided to offer his shares to the public.  
&gt;  
&gt;In comparison, privately held shares are not traded on the public market but through private transactions.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The process itself:**  
&gt;  
&gt;The steps undertaken in preparation for an IPO will vary, depending on the existing internal group structure spelled out in the Articles of Association. When going through an IPO‚Äôs engagement period, your registrar will carefully review your company‚Äôs Articles of Association and identify whether there are any share transfer restrictions. Following this the registrar will work, with other advisors to establish the actual mechanics behind effectively transferring the shareholdings to public / private buying institutions. The registrar ensures all required documentation and share delivery processes are in place.  
&gt;  
&gt;In terms of share conversion, the Listing Rules detail the administrative process for shareholders to transfer their equity shares from a Standard listing of shares to a Premium listing or any other type of share. The migration mechanism only applies to private companies with a listing of equity shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;If a certain class of share is publicly listed, then all shares in that class must be listed.

Found these articles on investing in ATH enviornment:

[Should You Buy An All-Time High?](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-buy-an-all-time-high/)

[Is Buying Stocks at an All-Time High a Good Idea?](https://mebfaber.com/2019/11/04/is-buying-stocks-at-an-all-time-high-a-good-idea/)

Essentially, it's showing based on past data that investing in ATH is not worriesome. Some notable callouts:

A. When  SP500 is near an all-time high, returns over the next year are similar to those when the SP500 is more than 5% away from an all-time high, which suggest fear of market crash could be more psychological. 


B. Average annualize return over the next three years when investing near an all-time high is 8.2% versus 7.4% when investing 5% away from an all-time high.


C. A strategy that just buy and hold stocks during ATH and switch to bond when it's not ATH, provide better performance and lower volatility than one that just buys stocks regularly. 


D. Similar observations made for international stocks.


IMO, the *most important* take away is to ensure that we have a (a) diversified portfolio, meaning not just investing in a single asset class, or worse a single company, and (b) not investing the entire nest egg at one single time but rather invest across time i.e. dollar cost averaging.

I did a bit of a quick research into this recently. But first, a quick recap of what Warren Buffet says about investing in IPOs:

* Warren Buffet has always been very vocal about his views on IPOs. His thought process is that ""*there are always better businesses to buy than IPOs*"". He always compares IPOs with other alternatives in the market, and so far, he has not found a strong justification for investing in an IPO versus another solid business at a good price.
* Buffet also dislikes the fact in IPOs, there are commissions that go to the stock salesmen, remember that IPOs are executed by investment banks so there is a push to sell IPOs like any other product, He likes to buy stocks where ""*no one is making any money on the sale*"".

I'd like to share with you some stats that I put together. Bear in mind the following:

* I took the [full list](https://www.iposcoop.com/scoop-track-record-from-2000-to-present/) of IPOs in the last 20 years from iposcoop.com.
* Filtered only companies that went public between years 2000 and 2015, so that at a minimum we have at least 5-6 years of post IPO performance.
* Calculated annualized performance using stock price from the first day close of IPO and current stock's price at the time this video was made.
* Performance from companies that are not currently trading were excluded.
* List [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/102ArUr35s1MLfyMm6rwnqhCvSo-L5f4JrmHAUlyk1pg/edit#gid=1482717621) for your reference.

**Results**:

* Total number of companies: 1396
* 45% of the companies (qty 616) have had negative annualized performance.
* 14% of the companies (qty 189) had sub 5% performance.
* **Almost 60% of IPOs between 2000 and 2015 underperformed the market.**

I also came across an [academic study](https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf) on Initial Public Offerings by Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the Warrington College of Business in the University of Florida. One piece of information that caught my attention in his paper is Figure number 2, labeled Percentage of IPOs with negative EPS. If you check the figure, you'll notice how in recent years **over 75% percent of the companies that have gone public have had negative earnings.**

When you buy shares of companies, you get a piece of the ownership and therefore a piece of the earnings . Well, with IPOs in the recent years, in 75% of the cases there is no earnings for your shares. You are literally investing with the expectation that the company will become profitable, which by the way is already factored into the price that you are paying. So if these new public companies fail to turn a profit, or perhaps if their path to profitability takes longer, the stock price will suffer. Your only chance is the company continuously beating expectations. Not to mention that you don't even have enough years of financial reports to build a solid foundation for analysis.

Hope this helps. I don't want to discourage anyone though, a lot of people have made good money on IPOs, but base on the data it's pretty obvious that the average investor should stay away from them."|investing|Should you invest in IPOs?|124.0|0.9|['EPS', 'the Warrington College of Business', 'Initial Public Offerings', 'the University of Florida']

Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc said on Wednesday it would allow companies issuing shares through its IPO Access platform to set aside some stock for members of the public with ties to the issuers.

Directed Share Programs (DSPs), which Robinhood refers to as its ""friends and family"" offering, allows employees, customers, vendors, or others who have a relationship with the issuing company an opportunity to buy shares at the IPO price.

As part of the DSP program, the company reserves a portion of IPO shares for a specific group of people and Robinhood helps distribute these shares to those select individuals.

In May, the popular online brokerage unveiled the IPO Access offering, which gives retail investors the opportunity to buy shares in IPOs.

Large institutional investors and funds have traditionally been the first in line for allocations on IPOs, as the investment banks that control share allocations typically prioritize deep-pocketed Wall Street clients.

That typically leaves most retail investors with no option but to buy into stock of a newly listed company only after its shares start trading - which often means paying a higher price.

Through its new platform, Robinhood works with Wall Street investment banks to get allocations for retail investors.

Robinhood has partnered with 12 companies¬†that have made their IPOs available to its customers, as of October 31.

Its latest offering will make IPO shares accessible to an even bigger pool of retail investors.

 1. WTI spread hits $10 a barrel for first time in eight years
 2. Crude stockpiles at U.S. storage hub are shrinking rapidly

Time will tell which one is out of sync.
Is it a forward oil curve that yields 11% on an annualized basis for investors, or is it a headline price of West Texas Intermediate crude near $83 a barrel?

Because if there‚Äôs one thing over which there‚Äôs growing consensus in the oil market, it‚Äôs that the forward curve is more reflective of $100-a-barrel oil than the current price.
The spread between the nearest two December contracts hit a premium of $10 a barrel this week. The only other time this century it has been so strong was in 2013. When more immediate prices are pricier than later ones, it is called backwardation and is normally viewed as a bullish indicator.
‚ÄúCrude backwardation remains relentless,‚Äù said Keshav Lohiya, founder of Oilytics, noting that the last time spreads were this strong WTI was above $100. ‚ÄúEither structure is too pricey or flat price is undervalued, our guess is the latter.‚Äù

The strengthening curve comes at a time when increasing numbers of analysts, traders and investors are once again talking of the prospects of oil prices returning to $100 a barrel. That possibility is being supported by an energy crisis that‚Äôs boosting demand for petroleum to be used for power generation, and steadily decreasing stockpiles worldwide.

In the case of WTI, though, the strength has been compounded this week by a sharp drop in inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, where oil futures are priced.
The market could be just weeks away from Cushing effectively running out of crude, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analysts including Natasha Kaneva said in a report. If nothing changes at the storage hub, WTI front spreads may spike to record levels and into a ‚Äúsuper-backwardation scenario,‚Äù they said.
Wagers on market structure show up in traders‚Äô positioning figures too. In WTI, one group of speculative investors is holding the largest position in spreads since 2008, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.

&gt;Reported loss for the quarter was $2.5 billion, compared with a $3.1 billion profit for the second quarter 2021. This was driven by significant adverse fair value accounting effects\* of $6.1 billion pre-tax, primarily due to the exceptional increase in forward gas prices towards the end of the quarter.

&gt;Zillow, the digital real estate company, said on Tuesday that it‚Äôs exiting Offers, its business that buys and flips homes, and eliminating 25% of its workforce.

&gt;The announcement was attached to Zillow‚Äôs third-quarter earnings report. The company‚Äôs revenue and earnings missed analysts‚Äô estimates.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated,‚Äù Zillow CEO Rich Barton said in the release. ‚ÄúContinuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility.‚Äù

&gt;The stock dropped about 7.5% in extended trading following a 10% plunge during regular market hours. The shares are now down about 10% for the year as of Tuesday‚Äôs close.

&gt;Here are the key numbers from earnings:

&gt;Earnings per share: loss of 95 cents adjusted vs. profit of 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts
Revenue: $1.74 billion vs. $2.01 billion expected by Refinitiv
Revenue in Zillow‚Äôs Offers business, which competes with Opendoor, climbed to $1.17 billion in the quarter. That‚Äôs way up from $186 million a year earlier, which was in the middle of the pandemic and in a dry period for transactions. However, the homes segment, which is mostly Offers, lost $422 million in the quarter, producing an overall net loss at the company.

&gt;Shares of Opendoor rose 7% in extended trading. The stock plunged alongside Zillow earlier in the day, dropping 15% at the close.

&gt;Zillow launched Offers in December 2019, starting with Southern California markets. The iBuying, or instant buying, product allowed homeowners to sell their home to Zillow for cash, eliminating a lengthy bidding, sales and closing process. They also didn‚Äôt have to worry about costly repairs before putting their house on the market.

&gt;‚ÄúAfter closing on a home, Zillow will take care of necessary repairs, working with local contractors to complete projects like a fresh coat of paint, servicing HVAC units and other work a typical homeowner would do to get their home ready for sale,‚Äù Zillow said in a press release at the time.

&gt;But the home-flipping market proved to be a drag for a company that had built its brand on listing homes across the country and helping buyers and sellers connect through a marketplace. Prior to shuttering the business, the company said on Monday that it would stop buying houses through the end of the year, citing tight labor and supply markets.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,‚Äù said Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow‚Äôs operating chief, in a statement this week. ‚ÄúWe have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings.‚Äù

&gt;Barton told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell‚Äù after the report that Zillow‚Äôs ultimate failure was its inability to predict housing prices accurately. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the market dried up. It then bounced back dramatically, and prices in many markets have climbed to record levels.

&gt;For the home-flipping business to be profitable, a company has to be able to sell a home for more than the purchase price and have enough margin remaining to cover all the other costs, such as maintenance and sales and marketing expenses. Barton said the company realized that it‚Äôs not in a position to accurately predict where home prices will be in six months ‚Äúwithin a narrow margin of error.‚Äù

&gt;Additionally, Barton said the Offers product reaches only a small sliver of the company‚Äôs overall audience, which is effectively the entire market of homebuyers and sellers across the country.

&gt;Zillow‚Äôs internet, media and technology business grew revenue 16% in the quarter to $480 million, with gross profit of just over $130 million.

&gt;‚ÄúWe just determined that being an iBuyer was too risky, too volatile and ultimately addressed too few customers,‚Äù Barton said. He added that, in closing the business, ‚Äúthe logic is clear, the emotion is difficult‚Äù because of the layoffs.

&gt;Bloomberg reported on Monday that Zillow was looking to sell 7,000 homes for $2.8 billion to institutional investors, as it looked to unload its portfolio of properties. Some of those sales would be for below the purchase price, Bloomberg said.

&gt;Barton didn‚Äôt confirm or deny the numbers in the Bloomberg report. He told CNBC that the company has always sold to those types of buyers since entering the market, and he acknowledged that Zillow does have properties that it needs to sell. The company bought 3,805 houses in the second quarter and sold 2,086 in that period.

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in any kind of fire sale,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wind down the inventory in an orderly way.‚Äù

1635900740.0|0.0|t3_qlivf6|0.0|"I'm struggling to justify the use of margin, particularly in naked puts. I learn best by doing, but before doing I need to learn, so I'm in a bit of a catch-22 with margin.

The problem I'm having is visualizing the risk-reward to using it. I can take on substantially more risk with cash than I can take on with margin. And I can substantially concentrate my trades more with cash than with margin. (That is to say, the more concentrated in higher volatility, the more my margin buying power just begins to look like cash-only).

So inevitably it looks like I can outperform with cash more than I can with margin.

Thus the question, how is margin actually useful?

For simplicity, if I want to 2x my buying power, but I have to reduce my return by 1/2x, then I have effectively accomplished nothing. Correct? So for margin to be useful I have to be able to both maintain a certain rate of return AND increase the buying power. Yes?

I have some other advanced questions about house surplus, equity and journaling times, but I think first I just need to see someone justify the use of margin in the first place.

Another problem with a margin call that I have is that it removes my ability to choose when I lose. Now the brokerage gets to choose when I lose, and they don't care if 2 weeks later the trade reverses and I would be a complete winner.

That alone is a very big hindrance when working a long-game high risk trade.

Maybe someone can comment a little on that as well.

15% S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO vs IVV)

60% Total US Stock Market ETF (ITOT VS VTI)

25% Total International ETF (IXUS vs VXUS)





I've decided to leave out bonds for now in my taxable account. Bonds tend to be pretty tax inefficient and I don't love muni bonds(which are more efficient). At some point I'll likely add a little or skew my tax advantaged bonds a little higher. Realistically I'll do just a little of both in the future. 



For now though, I like to be more US based with some international around 75/25. While total US stock market includes the S&amp;P 500, I do like to add some tilt to S&amp;P 500 which is why I have 15% of S&amp;P 500 ETF.  I'm open to shifting these ratios a little, so let me know your reasoning if you think so.


This leads me to picking the best ETF for my situation, and I'm mainly down to vanguards version vs iShares version (open to other suggestions too). The commission on all of these are free. The expense ratio for all of them are .03%. All of them are very similar. 




**This leads me to really the most important and last point since they are so similar, which one is the most tax efficient? While it doesn't seem like a huge deal when looking at it initially due to the differences being small, if you are in a higher tax bracket and intend to put a decent amount of money per month in this fund and keep it for a long time, even the smallest difference is an important consideration. This is where it gets a little more uncertain for me. It appears that they have a similar dividend, but Vanguard's are more consistently qualified dividends (so I would be paying capital gains tax compared to regular income tax) compared to iShares which appears too have been giving more non-qualified dividends lately. This leads me to going towards vanguards over iShares.

*Do futures trading and commodity trading negatively impact the spot price of the underlying?*

Futures and commodity trading are one of the main way (if not the main way) how spot prices get determined.

But the sheer scale of futures and commodities market and their notional value is mind boggling and almost none of them lead to actual underlying being delivered. This makes me wonder, if there were no futures or commodity trades, wouldn't there be much more demand for the ""real thing"" and wouldn't it make the price much more volatile and much more higher than current price (as demand for the price appreciation or depreciation of that product is being fulfilled electronically rather than using the underlying asset). Speculators are fulfilling their need for speculation by trading the derivative instead of the underlying, what if there were no derivatives?

I hear about silver being a manipulated commodity where SLV etf in conjunction with futures is being used to keep spot price low; some people even imply that futures and commodity trading have helped keep speculators invest their money in those assets thus reducing the overall inflation in the broader economy as their money chase may be S&amp;P 500 futures instead of investing that money into the ""real"" economy.

The Biden administration‚Äôs new vaccine-based travel rules are  forecast to boost jet fuel consumption as they bring the U.S. more in  line with the European Union, helping revive flights across the  Atlantic.¬†

The increased transatlantic travel will probably add at  least 250,000 barrels a day of crude demand, according to a senior  trader at a top oil-trading firm. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst  Fernando Valle also expects more than a quarter million barrels of daily  crude consumption coming back, thanks to less restrictions on global  vaccinated travelers in the U.S. and Europe.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve picked up a lot on domestic travel and should  pick up more than 250,000 barrels a day with easing restrictions on  vaccinated travelers,‚Äù Valle said.¬†

Air  travel remains a weak spot in the oil market‚Äôs recovery from an  unprecedented crash triggered by the pandemic last year, after flights  were grounded worldwide and commuters everywhere started working from  home. Air routes between the U.S. and Europe have historically been the  world‚Äôs most profitable for business travel.¬†

Under the new rules  taking effect Nov. 8, travelers from countries with low supplies of  vaccines who aren‚Äôt traveling on tourist visas, and those under 18, will  be exempt from the vaccine requirement.

George Dix, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects, sees  the boost from the new rules at 200,000 barrels a day of increased oil  consumption this quarter.

‚ÄúWe expect the main  boost to be from U.S.-Europe flights as U.S.-Latin America was already  operating close to pre-virus levels, and several other countries in  other regions are still some way off from opening up for international  flights,‚Äù Dix said.

For airlines, the recovery is coming with a higher cost for jet fuel, denting their earnings.

I wasn't aware that there was this concept of dual listing, so what I seem to have done so far is to randomly pick an exchange to buy whatever stock I want from. So for example I have a Belgian stock that I've bought on the D√ºsseldorf exchange even though it's also listed on the Viennese exchange. As far as I can recall there was some sort of weird tax when that company paid me dividends. I'm thinking now that if I had bought in Vienna then maybe that would have been avoided.

What I'm asking really is, what are the important differences between buying a stock on X and Y exchange? Is there potentially tax implications? If I buy all of my stock on the viennese exchange now because it's the cheapest with my broker and simplifies tax stuff, would I have a problem if I then moved to Germany, considering the fact that these stocks are also listed on German exchanges? Couldn't I just move the stock to a different exchange (this question doesn't even feel like it makes sense almost)?

In the last year, I've received a fair share of Instagram ads informing me about real estate investment offers, where the properties are managed (e.g. a hotel or furnished apartments) and as an investor I'm allowed to also use the property from time to time. Usually the return claimed is around 1.5-3%.

Usually, when I'm the person being approached about an investment opportunity I'm very sceptical: If it really were that good of an opportunity, why do you need to search for investors? At least for me, the up side would be that these can be funded with a mortgage with low interest of up to 1% (usually less).

Does anyone know how sensible such investments can be and if they are worth it?

I.e. Microsoft shareholders are getting a 3% yield ($66B/$2.2T) - with ~21% (and arguably 47%) growth. So if Microsoft just continues to grow as it's doing - and has been doing in recent years - we're talking a ~24% (3%+21%) net return. Sure, I'm simplifying, but fundamentally this makes sense.

This is INSANELY good especially when considering nearly half of Microsoft's revenue is recurring. I mean, if you were buying real estate with a 4% rental return, that'd end up around 2.5% net, you'd be very lucky to be getting 5% capital growth. That's a 7.5% (2.5% + 5%) net return at best. A 20% annualised return is what Warren Buffett, the world's best investor, used to consistently achieve in his heyday.

__Microsoft is no-brainer cheap, you should go ahead and buy. But it's not just Microsoft - all of GAFAM - Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft - which have a total market cap of $9T and up more than 10x over the last decade - do similarly well with the same basic analysis.__

How can this possibly be?

Ok, let's step back a bit, GAFAM, just 5 stocks, represent nearly 20% of the value of ALL listed companies in the US, up from 3% a decade ago. Think about that. Add other tech stocks to that and you have a monumental shift in the composition of US stocks. That needs a monumental shift in capital which needs investors to change their way of thinking. I mean, we're going through a real paradigm shift.

Now, sure, that shift is happening, we're all living it, but the world of finance, much of it controlled by older people fairly uncomfortable with technology, is going to lag - and this lag is the core reason why far from being some bubble, tech stocks in general are, despite their soaring valuations, still massively undervalued.‚Äù

Besides the top of the line Dream Edition series (available in a Range or Performance version), Lucid offers also the Air Grand Touring at a $30,000 lower price tag. Two more, less expensive version - Air Touring and Air - are expected to follow.Lucid Air Customer Deliveries Officially Begin

Ok so here is the scenario. I have 175 shares of a stock. According to my TDA account my trade price for those shares is $14.35. The stock is currently trading at $7.35 so I am thinking I want to sell 75 shares and take the loss to offset some gains I made this year collecting premiums from selling CC's. 

I am trying to understand the wash sale rule though. Investopedia says ""a wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss  and within 30 days of the sale (either before or after), you purchase  the same‚Äîor a ""substantially identical""‚Äîinvestment.""

The ""either before of after"" part has me a little confused though. If I refrain from re-buying shares of this ticker until December I should avoid a wash sale in the after section.

Would those purchases in any way be considered a wash sale or would my selling 75 shares today be enough to record the loss against my gains for the year as long as I don't rebuy shares for 30 days?

My post yesterday ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qhoh2e/thematic_and_ideas_based_investing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) seemed to generate a fair bit of interest and thought I'd share some things that I thought could be of interest back to you all to say thank you!

For a bit of background, I am a research analyst at Morgan Stanley and previously have worked as a buy-side equity analyst at JPM Asset Management and Lazard Asset Management. Though I was covering a specific sector (retail/luxury/e-commerce), part of the job spec meant creating baskets based on ideas for professional clients. For example, I would create a basket of c20 stocks that we thought was the best way to play the 'reopening post pandemic' or 'the luxury boom in China'. 

Often the purpose of this was so that clients who are very generalist can get exposure to macro themes or ideas without having to do the individual stock work which is very time consuming. 

I always thought this kind of product may be of interest to retail investors. I.e. you can construct a portfolio with a handful of baskets based on the themes you want to play at the time. For example, as an investor, you might be a data analyst at Google and believe that data is going to transform the world and no one knows it yet... how do you play that trend in the markets? It's hard right!

I'm sharing some of the types of things we used to put together at Morgan Stanley here:

\- COVID-19 driven data adopters ([here](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/msdotcom/what-we-do/wealth-management-images/uit/Data-era-adopters.pdf))

Just to also share, thought I'd attach JPM Ams latest guide to the markets ([here](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/market-insights/guide-to-the-markets/mi-guide-to-the-markets-us.pdf))

1635474855.0|0.0|t3_qi2pwd|22.0|"I would really appreciate any insights on how to properly evaluate  the cost of a small web-hosting business that has been generating over $100,000 each year since 2010. I switched to Stripe in 2014 where the  following table of gross volume is taken from, unfortunately data for  previous years are not available.

&gt;2014 - $128,100.00
&gt;
&gt;2015 - $231,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2016 - $163,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2017 - $130,300.00
&gt;
&gt;2018 - $143,200.00
&gt;
&gt;2019 - $120,000.00
&gt;
&gt;2020 - $96,034.36
&gt;
&gt;Since Jan 1, 2021 till Oct 28, 2021 - $103,700.00, expected more than $120,000
&gt;
That's gross volume generated, so how about expenses?

**Expenses**

After Stripe takes its share, the business pays the total of $653  monthly to US and EU based data-centers to host all customer projects,  about $45 do a CDN company, about $200 per month for the domain name  renewals. And literally **nothing else**: no license fees,  no any paid software (custom billing and customer support system build  on Drupal), no any money spent on advertisement (there is a potential to  grow, but didn't need any additional workload as the existing level of  more or less passively generated income was satisfactory), no any  contractors hired (a single experienced Drupal expert and system  administrator can carry all the occasional support requests as the whole  system is stable enough to run all by itself). Only need to pay his  share to uncle Sam.

Sounds ideal, so why sell?

**Reasons**

For last several years I have been involved in activities which exist  far from Drupal and technologies and which are gradually taking more  and more of my time. And while I will always be attached to everything  Drupal with strings of love, the other activities I'm involved are too  important to me (for that matter not only to myself, but lot's of other  people, so I have to set my priorities right).

To say frankly, I'm not desperate to sell, but find a reliable  partner who could equate what I'm putting on the table either by  bringing in their own business with similar income or to buy out the  half of already established and successfully running business. However,  in this case such a hypothetical partner will need to take over all the  current and future operations as my participation will be minimal.

**How much?**

I understand that in order to sell the company or partnership share  in the company, we need to know what is the total value of the company,  but I never did real evaluation. I know there are several methods to  calculate the price for a business, but not sure which one of them fits  best to this case:

\- **Return on Investment method**: It took many years  and lot's of efforts for my business to become an almost passive-income  generating source, but it's difficult to measure the cost of time and  labor spent.

\- **Sales of Comparable Businesses Method:** There are  not many comparable businesses as it is not Drupal shop per se, but  rather a hosing company with small loyal customer base. As I mentioned  above unlike Acquia or Pantheon my business is not advertising at all to  grow, it's not seeking to aggressively expand (maybe it should, because  potential is huge, however that was never a goal). And it's a small  niche, so not everyday companies like mine are sold.

\- **The industry formula approach**: The¬†the rule of  thumb of this method assumes any profitable business with a stable  income worth several times its annual profits depending on the industry  and the workload. Which means that if we take average of last 8 years  given on the table above (2021 is not over yet, so November and December  should bring around $20K, so this year's gross should be around  $120,000, but let's take the current revenue of $103,700) - **$139,416.8** \- and multiple to 2 years to get **$278,833.6** Nobody sane would sell a stable business like mine for this price. Would I sell my business for what it generates in 3 years **- $418,250.4**?  I would say no, because no another almost passive business would bring  me the same kind of revenue in the next 3 years, so better to keep the  business and start hiring and paying salaries. Would I consider selling  for 4 year generated revenue equivalent of **$557,667.2**?  Maybe, if the new owner accepts transfer of the current subscriptions  (yep, all customers are on recurring paid subscriptions) and customer  base without acquiring the name, trademark and equipment.

\- **Asset Value Approach**: Among assets besides  mentioned earlier custom-built billing and ticketing system, the  business has a recognizable name, domain name, registered trademark and  owns around $150,000.00 worth of server hardware. And while the cost of  hardware is easy to calculate, it's not obvious how to evaluate the  developed software, know-how, domain name, trademark. If this was done,  then the final price of the business would be more or less clear.

To conclude, there are lot's of different ways of evaluating a  business, however taking into account my business operates in unique  type of small niche, I'm not sure what is the fair price to sell it  completely or to invite someone to buy out their share as a partner.

This came up in the M1 Finance Sub, but I will share here.

People who say that Dividends are just a forced sale are flat out wrong. They will point to the fact that the stock price often drops on the dividend ex-date, but ignore the fact that it almost never drops by the exact amount of the dividend, and sometimes even goes up. If it's a ""forced sale"" that shouldn't happen.

But they are stubborn and refuse to consider that. So here's some more obvious evidence.

**Scenario 1:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest, and I buy a stock that pays a 3%+ dividend over time.
* I use the dividend to pay off the loan.
* After some time, the loan is completely paid off, and I now own those shares free and clear. They paid for themselves.

In this way, Dividend stocks have a few similarities to real estate in that you can buy the asset with borrowed money, and use it to pay for itself.

If Dividends were just a ""forced sale"" then as I pay off the loan, the value of my portfolio should decline to zero. Because otherwise ""its just inventing money out of nowhere.""

""But, that's just market returns! I can do that with growth stocks that don't pay dividends, just by selling some!"" No, you can't. At least, not always. Dividend stocks you can, growth stocks you can't.

**Scenario 2:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest. I buy growth stocks that don't pay a dividend.
* Market declines 10%
* I now have liabilities of $5,000 + interest, and assets worth $4,500.
* I can't even repay my loan by selling. Let alone make money. I have to pray the market turns around and my hot new tech stock works out and doesn't fall on its face.

**Scenario 3:**

* I borrow $5,000 from my M1 account at 2% interest. I buy dividend stocks that pay a 3%+ dividend
* Market declines 10%
* I use the dividend to pay off the loan
* I still have my portfolio of $4,500 worth of stock that I bought with somebody else's money.

I'm not saying growth stocks are bad. Growth stocks are good. I own a lot of them.

But the idea that ""dividends are just a forced sale"" is wrong.

When you buy a business, you are buying a value producing asset. Dividends are capitalizing on that value.

To return to the Real Estate comparison. Not exact, obviously, but illustrative to clarify

* Dividend stocks are rental properties (that you don't have to maintain). You buy the asset, and it produces income for you for as long as you own it. It will likely pay for itself over time.
* People who buy Growth stocks are ""House flippers"". They don't take any of the income the property could produce by renting it. Instead they fix it up, and hope to sell it to somebody at a higher price. If you pick the right house in the right neighborhood, this works if the market is going up. You can get burned if the market is going down.

Both are valid ways of making money. Both produce value.

But to say ""Dividends are just a forced sale"" indicates somebody who doesn't understand how dividends work."|investing|"""Dividends are just a forced sale"" is wrong."|0.0|0.39|['Dividend', 'Growth', 'House']

&gt;The performance benchmarks show the Intel Core i5-12600K blasting up the single-core test with a score of 773 points and the multi-core test with 7220 points. This puts the Core i5 Alder Lake at a massive 50% lead over the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and even faster than AMD's 8 core and 16 thread Ryzen 7 5800X which is very impressive. Versus the leaked Core i5-12400 benchmarks, the Core i5-12600K offers a 45% increase in multi-threaded performance which means that those E-cores are being used properly plus the higher clock speeds really push the performance even further. Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.

&gt;Now think about it this way, you are essentially getting slightly better performance than the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, a $400 US+ chip, in a processor that costs $30 US lower than the Ryzen 5 5600X. It sounds like an absolutely phenomenal deal. Obviously, there are a few drawbacks which include investing in a brand new platform and migrating to a new OS platform (Windows 11 in this case) which would raise the cost and effort but if you set your mind aside from these short-term concerns, the Core i5-12600K could end up serving you far better performance at an insane value proposition.

My question is: is it true that over the past 4 years TECL would really return like 500 percent (roughly) without hitting 0?

The 1 other friend says to check at most 1 time every month, nothing more. His logic is that Robinhood and other brokerage accounts will usually on the front page after logging in tell you what you have in stocks, how much they are up for you since buying - and this can trigger something inside you to say ""made too much money to loose, sell now""...

1635203542.0|0.0|t3_qfszg9|9.0|" I've been thinking about how most healthcare business models are not really as health focused as everyone would like to think. Kind of crazy to put it like that but it's the truth in many cases. For example a dentist makes a lot more money if they can do a crown and a root canal on you than a filling or a preventive service. This is why dentists don't march on Washington DC to have added sugar banned, that would be great for health, but horrible for the dental industry under the current business model. Or a doctor makes more money for giving you a pill for the symptoms of a problem, rather than helping you make lifestyle changes to actually solve or prevent the problem. This is why there is fast food in many hospitals. And many biotech companies often end up aiming to produce ongoing treatments for things, rather than cures which are a one time payment. 

Anyway there are some bright spots, it's not all like that, for example pediatric dentistry is a much more health focused model.  But I was wondering if anyone had ideas on how we could financially incentivize dentists for example by how many teeth they save or something like that?

&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.

&gt;Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.

&gt;Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.

&gt;""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.

&gt;Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).

&gt;Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.

&gt;""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.

&gt;Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).

&gt;Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more

&gt;Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more

&gt;However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.

&gt;""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""

&gt;Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.

&gt;Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more

&gt;""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.

&gt;Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.

&gt;Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.

&gt;The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.

&gt;""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.

&gt;""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""

&gt;Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.

&gt;Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.

&gt;With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

&gt;Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.

&gt;Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

**Edit**: Imagine you time travel back to October 25th, 2019. Two years ago, TSLA stock was trading at **$59.64**, pre-split, and have the following conversation with someone:

You: I came from the future, in 2 years TSLA will be trading at $1,000 and is part of the S&amp;P500.

I'm generally cautious of throwing more money at real estate since our house is already such a volatile, leveraged part of our financial portfolio (very young with a \~12% down payment). But REITs such as IVR are still drastically lower than pre-covid levels. Here's my bull thesis:

1. \~ 10% dividends. This is my primary reason for investing.
2. Even at current rates, the stock price seems depressed
3. If (when, IMO, but if), rates increase these stocks should be some of the main benefactors.

So in my eyes, I'm seeing a low risk 5%+ APY (giving space for the stock to continue dragging down, or for divs to be cut down) that's also a good hedge to rate raising (not penciled in, but possible with all the hyperinflation \*hype\* going on).

Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to thinks this is a good idea, and I‚Äôve had 2 relatives live for 5-10 years (to the present) on this strategy. I want to know what Reddit thinks.

I‚Äôm curious to see how people have their assets weighted between different asset classes at the moment. 

I think I'm about 45% Stocks, 35% Property, 20% Cash,

*Edit, as others have suggested, adding any other info you're comfortable adding will make the numbers more meaningful, such as age, annual income and total investment value...*

And because I need more than 400 characters or this post gets deleted, feel free to say if you have any plans on changing this % split any time soon, maybe you are high cash at the moment as expecting a market pullback soon, in which case will move cash to stocks then etc."|investing|What is the % split of your assets?

If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield. 

Are these assumptions correct? If so, are there better alternatives? TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

Is there any asset class from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates?"|investing|Are there any asset classes from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates to contain inflation?|14.0|0.67|['FED', 'TIPS']

I have been debating with myself for the last week if all the recent news around Facebook building a Meta-verse already priced in, or it is too early for investors to realize the big picture and potential upside of that?

Following a few recent articles [article#1](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-plans-hire-10000-eu-build-metaverse-2021-10-17/) and [article#2](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/09/facebook-zuckerberg-metaverse-stephenson-big-tech) and also all the progress they have been making about making Oculus more affordable, it seems that they are planning to spend a lot of $$$ on this in the next few years. 

On the other hand we also have Unity working in the same direction [article#3](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/27/how-unity-is-positioning-itself-to-democratize-the-metaverse/) and [article#4](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459091-unity-software-the-metaverse-can-be-a-game-changer). I wouldn't be surprised if they team up with Facebook to accelerate the growth and absolutely dominate the market. They would have both the capital and the technology to be the first and the best.

I am trying to stay away from the negative sentiment towards FB right now around all the politics around all the social platforms, I am aware that can have a very negative impact towards the short terms stock price, but looking at the big picture it is probably not going to hurt them too much.

In the same time we have all the climate changes, possible economic crises coming in the next years, that could make life much tougher for the lower and middle class, which would make escaping into a meta-verse, a very tempting solution for millions of people... Quite much looking like the plots of Ready Player One and Snow Crash.

What do you think? Am I missing something? Of course this is not an investment for big $$$ tomorrow or next year, I am thinking more around a 3-7 year horizon."|investing|Investing for the metaverse? Are Facebook and Unity the big winners?|16.0|0.69|['Meta']
